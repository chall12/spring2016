Reflection:

I wasn't able to test the file open in exercises 2 and 3 because the file name contained a hyphen which Trinket doesn't support. As a result, when I ran the program for exercise 2, I got an IOError, which is a case that had not been addressed. So I put a try/except block around the whole program to capture the case where the file doesn't exist.
