Reflection:

I used regex in the first exercise to create a list of strings, but in the next exercises, it was difficult to figure out the correct regex expression to use so I used the string split method instead. In all, I really liked the exercise; it was good practice with dictionaries and regex. Although I would like to know what the regex expression for the second exercise is.
