Reflection:

My original idea was to create a maze game in which the user has to navigate to get to the treasure. But making an actual maze with walls would have been a lot of work to get the turtles to draw it appropriately. So I decided to make an obstacle course instead with randomly placed turtles as obstacles. The next step is to save the location of each of the randomly placed turtles so that I can detect when the user trespasses over them and ask them to start over.
