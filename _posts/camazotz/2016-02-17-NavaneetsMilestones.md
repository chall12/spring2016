Drawing app goal: This app will allow the user to fill the screen with tessellations. The tessellation starting shape will be a square shape that is half white and half black. When the user clicks on a shape, the adjacent shapes should be drawn. This process will continue until tessellations fill the screen.

Milestones:

- [ ] Create a tessellation shape module
- [ ] Place one shape at a random location on the screen as a starting point for the user
- [ ] Add width/height parameters and color in the appropriate parts
- [ ] Add a click handler function that draws adjacent shapes with the appropriate color patterns
