Gameplay: I want to build the classic game 'Snake'. The snake moves on the screen according to user input (with arrow keys) towards objects on the screen. As it swallows these objects, it grows in length. The snake is not allowed to collide with any of the four "walls" of the screen (defined by some preset coordinates and perhaps outlined by a colored border) or itself.

Milestones:

- [ ] Create the snake shape
- [ ] Set the boundaries of the walls
- [ ] Take user keyboard input and move the snake accordingly
- [ ] Randomly place objects on the screen
- [ ] Grow the snake when it swallows an object
- [ ] End the game if snake collides with the wall
- [ ] End the game if snake collides with itself

Stretch milestones:

- [ ] Make the objects images of food rather than random shapes
- [ ] Add additional obstacles on the board
- [ ] Add objects that reduce snake's size if the user reaches them within a given time
- [ ] Add a point system that increases as the snake swallows more objects
