Reflection:

The exercise gave me a better idea of accessing JSON data. I enjoyed the chapter reading - it clarified some terms and concepts that I had heard before but hadn't really understood. For example, the bit on Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) was something I had heard before but hadn't really understood. Also the discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of XML and JSON (along with sample examples of each) was very interesting. It tied in very nicely with some reading I've been doing for another class on representing knowledge in a way that computers can understand. I was reading about the idea of the Semantic Web and how XML can further aid software programs in understanding content intended for humans. It was basically discussing the idea of how to more explicitly represent information so the comparison between JSON and XML further clarified some of those ideas.
