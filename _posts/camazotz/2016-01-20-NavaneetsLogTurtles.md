Reflection:

It was fun making this exercise. I was trying to make the turtle responsive to key presses (such as the up, down arrows on the keyboard) to move on the screen according to the user input but I wasn't sure how to do that without using functions. Instead I had the user type in a direction and a distance to move and moved the turtle towards teh target that way.
