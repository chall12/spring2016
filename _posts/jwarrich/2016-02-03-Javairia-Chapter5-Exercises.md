Reflection: 
This was an interesting exercise to do. In the second exercise where we had to list the max and min, I had to think about whether I wanted to create a function outside of the loop or do everything within the loop. Which choice would be the best? I ultimately chose to make functions for the min and max because I thought it would be easier to just call the functions within the loop that I had created for exercise 1.
