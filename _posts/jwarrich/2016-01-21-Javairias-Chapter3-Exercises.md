Reflection:
One of the first things that I gained by doing these exercises was that I was able to fix a problem that I had when doing the previous exercise. Previously, I had trouble with getting an output that contained both string and a numerical value. After learning how to do that in class, I was able to include that in these exercises. A thing that I got stuck on in Exercise 3 was how to make sure that the input was between 0.0 and 1.0. I ended up using another if statement.
