Reflection:

Since last class, I have had time to reflect on my original idea and see if it was what I really wanted to do. Once I started working on it, I realized that it was taking way too much of time to pull the data that I needed.  I wanted to use player stats from each game, but I could not find a dataset that had this information. So, while I was struggling to find a dataset, I actually found something that was a little more interesting. **New Idea** - I found a dataset of NBA player salaries and want to compare it to salaries of Women NBA players. I thought this would be really cool to actually see the difference and bring light to an important issue of wage gap. The information that I found was pretty surprising so hopefully anyone that uses this program will gain something from it. With that said, I had to adjust my milestones a little bit but the overall theme is the same. I was able to complete the milestones that I set for Tuesday. I think I will use this week to set up the different options under the main menu. My milestones aren't as detailed as I would like, but I have noticed that I am able to work better this way because ideas come to me as I work so I will include more specific milestones as I get more involved with my project.  

Tuesday Milestones (revised from 4/14 class): 

 - [x] make men and women salaries into txt files
