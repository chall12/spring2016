**Reflection**

Since last class, I haven't accomplished as much as I wanted to, but I am slowly making progress. One thing that has helped me out is drawing out my project. I mentioned in my update 2 that at times I was getting confused with some of my code (which is never a good thing). Drawing it out made it easier for me to complete my milestones. Currently I am working on finding a way to take in user input. I made a table that has all the names of nba/wnba players, but have not figured out a way to search the user input within the table. The while loop keeps starting over without printing the results. I think once I am done with this step, everything else should be fairly easy since my other options are similar in structure to this first one.
