Here is my Clicky turtle program

Reflection:

In this program, the user has to click on the screen until they find the jackpot of 50 grams of gold. Similar to the treasure hunt game, a random x and y coordinate was chosen and the closer the user gets to that x,y the closer they are to winning. I made a simple helper function that helps with the visual of the program and allows me to not repeat code. One thing that I learned from doing this exercise is that I had to really think about my skills as a programmer. I had to change my original idea around because I wasn't sure on how to do certain things. In the future, I hope to improve upon this program and include more things.
