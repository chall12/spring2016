Reflection:

When refactoring the code, one of the first things I did was make a dictionary for the colors and peices. This was an obvious choice. I then looked at other parts of the code to see if there were anything else that I could group. The visual aspects of the display were a huge part of the main code. I took it out and created another page for it so that it would help with readability.
