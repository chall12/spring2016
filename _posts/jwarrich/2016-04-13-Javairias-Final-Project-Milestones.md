Project Idea:

I have chosen to do the data analysis project. After a great season of North Carolina basketball, I wanted to make a program using Trinket that will analyze different stats as they relate to this past season. The user can look at the players individual stats or the team as a whole. I also want the user to be able to choose a specific game in the season and be able to look at player/team stats for that game. I am trying to find a csv file with the information for this season but have not found one yet so I might end up making my own using the mockaroo website that was mentioned by Collin in class. Other information that I want to include is min/max points scored by each player and team. There's a lot of things that I could do the information, so once I get started I think I will have more concrete ideas.

**Revised**:
So after talking with my partner and group, I got some clarity with some of the ideas that I had. First off, thanks to Erica, I got a better understanding of what mockaroo does and realized it is not what I want to use. I've decided to create my spreadsheet and then convert it to a csv. I have found the data I want to use so I just have to pull it and make a single csv file. 

Milestones:

 - [ ] Get multiple csv files 
 - [ ] create max/min functions  
 - [ ] visualize data 
 - [ ] allow user input 
 - [ ] have help text available 
 - [ ] custom modules
 - [ ] for loops
 - [ ] dictionaries
 - [ ] custom functions
 - [ ] handle bad user input
 - [ ] check data for errors

**Revised Milestones**

For next Tues: 

 - [ ] Move all info relating to player, team, and opponet into separate csv files
 - [ ] Check dataset for error
 - [ ] import csv 
 - [ ] create main menu
 - [ ] create numbered options for player, team, opponent 
 - [ ] allow user input 
 - [ ] allow user to read through each data set
 
To be scheduled: 

 - [ ] make functions for that find max, min, average 
 - [ ] create specific options for users under each data set
 - [ ] Possible opponent stat options: list of opponents, score of specific game
 - [ ] possible player stats: scoring averages, specific player profile
 - [ ] possible team stats: scoring, win/losses, team averages
 - [ ] handle bad user input
 
Stretch
 - [ ] compare player stats
