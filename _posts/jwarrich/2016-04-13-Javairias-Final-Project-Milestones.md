Project Idea:

I have chosen to do the data analysis project. After a great season of North Carolina basketball, I wanted to make a program using Trinket that will analyze different stats as they relate to this past season. The user can look at the players individual stats or the team as a whole. I also want the user to be able to choose a specific game in the season and be able to look at player/team stats for that game. I am trying to find a csv file with the information for this season but have not found one yet so I might end up making my own using the mockaroo website that was mentioned by Collin in class. Other information that I want to include is min/max points scored by each player and team. There's a lot of things that I could do the information, so once I get started I think I will have more concrete ideas.


Milestones:

 - [ ] Get multiple csv files 
 - [ ] create max/min functions  
 - [ ] visualize data 
 - [ ] allow user input 
 - [ ] have help text available 
 - [ ] custom modules
 - [ ] for loops
 - [ ] dictionaries
 - [ ] custom functions
 - [ ] handle bad user input
 - [ ] check data for errors
