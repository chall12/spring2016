Reflection:
These three programs allowed me to apply the basic concepts covered in Chapter 2. One thing that tripped me up when doing Exercise 3 was including the type for each variable. When I didn't include the int() it gave me an error. Specifying the type was the only thing that confused me. A thing that I still have a question about is how to print out string and integers at the same time.
