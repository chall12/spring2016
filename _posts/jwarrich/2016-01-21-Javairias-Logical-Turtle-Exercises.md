Reflection:
Doing this exercise allowed me to do something unique with different inputs given by the user. It was really helpful to use conditionals because by being able to use them, I had more room to be creative with the output of my program. One small obsticale that I encountered was forgetting to identify the user input as an integer so that the if/else statements would execute.
