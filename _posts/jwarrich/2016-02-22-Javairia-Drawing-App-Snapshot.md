Reflection:

So far, the app looks like the way I want it. I still have to include colors that the user can choose from and then find a way to fill the colors into the area that the user picks. I am not completely sure on how to do that. Also I am thinking if there's a better way for the user to choose between the two picture options. As of now, I have it so that the if the user clicks on the left side it calls the oldwell function but the problem with this is that if the user clicks on the right it begins to draw the belltower. I need to find a way that allows both pictures/screes to be separate.
