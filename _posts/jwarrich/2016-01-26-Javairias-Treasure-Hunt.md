Reflection:

When doing this assignment, I started off a little confused. I had to go back and look at what loops are and how they work. Once I understood that, I looked to see what all I needed to accomplish and took it step by step. One thing that I got stuck on was creating the ranges and knowing whether the turtle color was working according to the range. Because I didn't know what the random x and y coordinates were, it was hard to know whether I was doing the assignment correctly.
