**Reflection**

Since last class, I created options under each main option. I am currently working on adding functionality to each of these sub options. One roadblock that I’ve had is organizing the way I write the program. At one point yesterday, I was a little confused on what options I created and whether I included certain functions in the main while loop. I think the best way to tackle this problem is writing it out on paper and keeping track of what I’ve done. Drawing out how I want the project to look will help be keep track of everything and help me visualize what I have done and need to do. A thing that I’ve learned about myself through this process is that I get more ideas when I’m not solely working on the project. Through this I’ve come up with more milestones and stretch milestones. Finally, something that I can improve upon is rationalizing all the ideas that I have and picking the ones that will make my program the most usable and beneficial for the user. I am constantly thinking about what options I could add, without thinking about whether I really need those options. I do not want to overwhelm the user and myself. 

**Revision 4/21 class** 
After talking to Omar, he brought up the point that there would be more room for user error in my suboption of player name. I hadn't really thought about that so it was nice to someone else's view on the program. I decided to specify the user input to only last names. This will decrease user error and make it easier for me to regex the user input. Also realized that my snapshot did not embed properly so I've updated that as well
