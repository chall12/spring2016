**Reflection**

Since last class, I created options under each main option. I am currently working on adding functionality to each of these sub options. One roadblock that I’ve had is organizing the way I write the program. At one point yesterday, I was a little confused on what options I created and whether I included certain functions in the main while loop. I think the best way to tackle this problem is writing it out on paper and keeping track of what I’ve done. Drawing out how I want the project to look will help be keep track of everything and help me visualize what I have done and need to do. A thing that I’ve learned about myself through this process is that I get more ideas when I’m not solely working on the project. Through this I’ve come up with more milestones and stretch milestones. Finally, something that I can improve upon is rationalizing all the ideas that I have and picking the ones that will make my program the most usable and beneficial for the user. I am constantly thinking about what options I could add, without thinking about whether I really need those options. I do not want to overwhelm the user and myself.
