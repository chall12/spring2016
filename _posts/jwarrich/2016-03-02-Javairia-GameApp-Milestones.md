 - [ ] Make food 
 - [ ] Create score by counting how much food is eaten 
 - [ ] Create other turtles 
 - [ ] Create multiple levels
 - [ ] Take in user input (up/down/right/left)
 - [ ] Identify when user hits wall or is eaten by other turtles
 - [ ] Have win screen
 - [ ] Have lose screen
 - [ ] Possibly add sound effects
 - [ ] Have quit/reset (optional)
