Reflection:

These exercises really integrated a lot of the concepts that we've recently discussed. I found myself going back to three chapters specifically including List, Dictionaries, and Regular Expressions. By looking at the examples in these chapters, I was able to complete the exercises. Something that I had a litle trouble with was finding the max. I tried the largest loop that was given, but it would return the second largest value instead of the largest. I ended up just using the built in max function.
