Reflection:
The exercises were pretty straightforward, the only one we had difficulty with was exercise 4. A problem we ran into was appending the payment type to the end of an existing list. With Elliots help, we figured out that the payment type was being recognized as a string, so we had to make it into its own list. Overall, this was a good introduction.
