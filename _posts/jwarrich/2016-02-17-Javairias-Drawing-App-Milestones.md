My current idea for this drawing app is to create something similar to a coloring book. I'll allow the user to pick a theme and then use colors to fill in the picture.

Milestones:
- [ ] Create two images that the user can choose from (possibly UNC themed)
- [ ] The image that is clicked on is expanded into a bigger version
- [ ] Have different colors ready for the user to choose
- [ ] User is able to click color
- [ ] Area on picture is filled by the color
- [ ] Make a button that allows user to clear the picture

Hopefully, I'll be able to create this vision.
