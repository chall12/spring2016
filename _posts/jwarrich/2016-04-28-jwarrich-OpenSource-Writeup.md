For my open source contribution, I completed a testing task for Mozilla Firefox. I learned about contributing to Mozilla Firefox from one of the meetups that I went to earlier in the semester (Pearl Hacks). What I did for my testing task was run a sanity test for graphic issues within the firefox browser. The point of this task was to see whether there were any issues with the browser while I was going through the steps listed. Issues could inclue crashes, slow performance, visual problems, or scrolling issues. The issue that I had was slow performance. I played two videos in two different tabs and lagging was an issue. I included my comment in the feedback form. Overall, this was a good experience. Even something as small as testing the browser allowed me to give input on well known project like Mozilla Firefox. In the future, hopefully I can contribute more to open source projects!
