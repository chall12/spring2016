This exercise is deceptively difficult. I especially had problems using global variables so that they could be defined over all of my 
modules. I believe that I was finally able to define the global variables and functions. The next problem that I ran into was that 
I introduced an infinite loop somewhere and it kept making my browser crash. I don't know where it happened so it was kind of hard to 
troubleshoot. I understand now why the use of modules is so important. Although the coder that made this program probably thought they 
were being organized keeping all of the variable/function definitions together (or they did it on purpose as an exercise) it makes it 
quite difficult to separate out the parts. It is like spaghetti that departs from one point in all directions (I had a lot of problems
with Jay). 

I have commented out large amounts of my code because it is broken into an infinite loop (I think).
