These programs were deceptively difficult for me. When I first looked at them I thought they would be simple; they weren't

Exercise 1:
I used x, y, and z as my sum, total number, and average variables.
I used b as a dummy variable that would stop the while loop.
Within the while loop I had the program ask for a number (try/except for valid inputs). If the try was true then I had the 
program perform the math operations for me and then go back up and wait for another input. If done was typed then the value of 
b was changed so that the while loop was not longer true and it exited the loop. It printed the numbers and I was done.
  For awhile my numbers kept adding up twice. I changed something random and it fixed itself. 
  
Exercise 2:
I used the skeleton of the program from exercise 1 and just changed my math operations.
I used two if/else loops to compare the input to the highest and lowest inputs so far (a and b). I initially set a and b 
to 1000000 and -1000000. I am sure that there is a way to compare my input to + infinity and - infinity but I couldn't find 
anything online.
  This program was easier than the first. I was able to recycle quite a bit which only let two if/else conditionals to write for
  success.
