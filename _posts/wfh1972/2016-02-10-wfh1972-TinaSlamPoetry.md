Reflection:

This exercise was relatively easy. There are some things that I need before a lightbulb goes off. They are:
1) I don't understand the "return" feature of inputs/variables. i.e. I know that there is an easier way to get an input and then tell 
if it invalid. I also know there is an easier way to get a specific input ("done") and then move out of the loop but don't always know
how it works.
2) Try, except, for, and loops in general need some work (by me).
