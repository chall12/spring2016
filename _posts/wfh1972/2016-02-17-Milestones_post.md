Overall goal: to create a drawing program that lets the user draw on the screen, change colors of drawing, select a turtle shape, and
clear a screen. If I have time I would also like the use to be able to control the turtles speed using the keyboard and draw preselected
shapes. 

Milestones: 
[] Organized code in well commented modules
[] Use numbers 1-10 to select colors
[] Allow user to change turtle shape using keyboard
[] Allow user to control turtle speed using up/down arrows (optional)
[] Allow user to draw preselected shapes (e.g. square, circle) (optional)
[] Use five different turtle commands that I don't already know
[] Allow screen clears
