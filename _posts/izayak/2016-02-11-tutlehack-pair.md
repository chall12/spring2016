In pair exercise, we took turns to be the navigator and the driver. Wayne quickly came up with an idea about how to fulfill the first   
feature as a navigator, then I wrote it out. This is a quite good cooperation. Then we kind of stuck with how to achieve the second   
feature. The problem is that we have different ideas about how to do that and kind of did not really get the partner's idea. That's what 
I am thinking about now. I figured out how to do it in my way but cannot figure out how to do it in Wayne's way, so I think it is because  
that I did not really get Wayne's idea.   
Now in the Trinket the second and third features are fulfilled by me in the way I was thinking. These two features are basically achieved  
in the same way. I think Wayne can add his method later as I know he has some other arrangements.  
The pair programming for novice like us can be slower, but getting insights from each other can be really helpful for opening minds.
