**Updated Milestones**  
- [x] Set up a basic sturcture (Trinket code)  
- [x] Build up functions for drawing shapes, lines etc.  
- [x] Users can control the screen with keys  
- [x] Accepts users' clicks  
- [x] Have an entirely graphical user interface (i.e. no printed text input besides what turtle.write())  
- [x] Allow the user to select a drawing mode that changes the programâ€™s repsonse to clicks and/or keys  
- [x] Display the current mode and other relevant information to the user  
- [x] Allow the user to choose and draw shapes, lines, and colors depending upon the selected mode  
- [ ] Allow the user to clear the drawing and start over    
- [ ] Utilize custom modules for readability and organization  
- [ ] Utilize custom functions for modularity  
- [ ] Utilize definite loops (i.e. for loops)  
- [ ] Utilize multiple Turtle objects  
- [ ] Utilize a named Screen object  
- [ ] Run without errors  
- [x] Be well-commented  
- [ ] Be well-organized and readable    
Finished small parts, and the whole structure (e.g. loops) will be built later.

**Questions**  
1. <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/4c810fbcf0" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
If we put a function into the screen.onkey() function, the function cannot take arguments as it is not been called. So in this case the go_left() functions etc. can only be placed in main.py? [solved]    
2. In order to enter clicks mode, have to press '2' key 2 times... [just click 2 times...]
