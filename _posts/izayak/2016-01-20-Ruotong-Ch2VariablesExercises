Embeded link from Trinket:

Some ideas:
1. The print function is not the same as in the Python interpreter, also not the same as in the textbook. Changed the format to work out.
2. I found out that in Trinket's Python interpreter I should use ' ' instead of " ". While in Python interpreter, either works.
