Thoughts  
I just use the same 'count', 'total' and 'num' variable names in the two exercises. So if in the first one the user hits enter button
before inputing 'done', the nan of result of average will pass to the the next one. But if the user inputs done directly without hitting  
the enter button, that would be fine.
