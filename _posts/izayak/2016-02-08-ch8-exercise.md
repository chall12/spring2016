*Thoughts*
The Debugging section in the textbook is really useful. We should be careful with the differences between strings and lists. 
Cannot find the file 'mbox-short.txt'.  
Also did exercise 4-6, and have one question about question 6 (comment in Trinket to show). I found in the comment of my  
ch5's exercise's pull request that it should be covered in class, but I cannot remember it.
