In my program I created another turtle named Jerry to play around with Tina. You'll see Tina chasing Jerry for some reason :p
As there is a chasing feature, the import time and time.sleep() can be very useful because if tina does not get to Jerry he will fleet away.  
I've used a function to generate random number to be used as Jerry's location's coordinates. At first I tried to make the whole jerry.goto()  
into a helper function but did not succeed.  
For ending the game, either Jerry is caught or Jerry fleet away. I think it would be better to add another one: for too long that Tina  
has not caught Jerry with further knowledge.
