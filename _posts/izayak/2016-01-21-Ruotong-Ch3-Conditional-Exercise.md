Here is the embeded link from Trinket:

My thoughts:  
1. I tried to print 'No input' if there is no input to variables 'hour', 'rate' etc.   
I searched online and find this on Stack Overflow:  

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18542107/python-test-if-raw-input-has-no-entry  

Then I used the boolean operator 'not' to achieve that.  
I also checked that 'not' has a higher precedence than 'or' through the document (part 5.15):  

https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html  

Or the following link neatly provide only the table:

My questions:  
1. For exercise 3, for score less than 0 or greater than 10, I print 'Bad score' in the try part. Should that be put in except part? <\n>
I also add a comment in the Trinket file to indicate that question's position.  

Update:  
This problem is solved when I do the Chapter4 Exercise.
