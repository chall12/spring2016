**Overall Reflection**    
I am very glad that we are assigned this final project instead of a final exam since we can learn more from a project like this. I gained quite a lot coding experience during the process of building this data analysis program. Although it is small comparing to programmers in industry, I haven't imagined one day I can write a program that is more than a thousand lines. 




**Milestones**     

- [x] (new1,fin1) Set up cloud 9  
- [x] (new1,fin1) Load data file (part: loaded concised version of one data file)  
- [x] (new1,fin1,fin2,fin3) Data cleaning (tried data cleaning, tweets and time zone variables problem solved)  
- [x] (new1,fin1,fin2) Build lists and dictionaries to get information from the data (part: built nested dictionaries, also need dictionaries of negative reason and airlines etc. separately; the remaining part finished in update2)  
- [x] (new1,fin2) Make readable tables based on dictionaries, thinking of alignment  
- [x] (fin2) Try one simple descriptive statistics calculation and do visualization on a particular data file (In my mind the first try would be calculation the total number of complaints towards different airlines in data file airline.csv, and make a histogram.)    
- [x] (new1) Before using regex with tweets, find a way to make tweets' materials loaded successfully  
- [x] (fin3) Use regex to deal with texts (i.e. tweets in airline.csv and gopdebate.csv, 'time created' variable)   
- [x] (new2, fin3) Before studying time and time zones, find a way to load them i.e. figure out how to deal with this error: UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xbe in position 5427: invalid start byte    
- [x] (new2, fin3) Study the pattern of time, for example, according to days of week (Thanks for Erica's suggestion on Tuesday!)  
- [x] (update2, fin3) Use a function to implement the analysis of airlines and sentiment and negative reasons since they are similar, this one is for separate  
- [x] (new2, fin3) Use a function to implement analysis of airlines and sentiment, airlines and negative reasons' relationship  
- [x] (fin4) Generalize the program to make it work for different data files: make some variables flexible; add conditionals; let the user input which columns map to what kind of data etc.  
- [x] (fin4) Make a text-based interface   
- [x] (fin4) Add help text (think of in what way to achieve that)   
- [x] (fin4) The user should be able to perform any number of supported actions and then exit the program   
- [x] (fin4) Check if the program is well-formatted (comments, organized, readable), error and bug free   



**Stretch/Optional Milestones**          

- [ ] Think more ways to do data visualization through text printouts (scatter plot, density line)     
- [ ] matplotlib, 3rd party modules   
- [x] (fin4) Do more descriptive statistics analysis such as summary statistics (max, min, mean, etc.)    
- [ ] (new4) Use other tools deal with data cleaning and tweets
