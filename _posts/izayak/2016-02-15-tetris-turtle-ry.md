- Added some functions to make the program more concise  
- Put all the functions, dictionaries, turtle setups together
- Added comments to make the program more readable
- Also tried to make some repetitive part in those drawing functions into functions, but that would make the program unreadable


*Problems*  
- Read the documentation of Python about tracer, do not get what "A replica of the corresponding TurtleScreen method" means.
