I participated these two meetups in Durham on this Monday and last Sunday. Both of these two meetups do not have a specific topic, and people can code whatever they want, work on their current work or projects, seek help from each other or share ideas of technologies. For the first one, there is no restriction of languages to be used, Javascript, Python, Ruby, Java, shell scripting, R, C, .NET, Objective-C, CSS, AngularJS etc. are all fine. And for the second one, the programming activitity is for Python users.   
I participated both the two meetups with my friends, and at both of the meetups I met some of my classmates. We discussed about our final projects there. During the first meetup, we met two JavaScript programmers. One of them is a computer science major student who is already graduated and we shared some thoughts of new programming tools. I did data cleaning and file loading of the final project in the rest of the time. During the second meetup, I and my friend discussed the final project together. I continuely worked on data cleaning and tried to fix errors from loading the data.
