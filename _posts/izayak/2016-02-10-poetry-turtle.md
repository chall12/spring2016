**Reflection**
This poetry turtle practice is interesting and can help practice with what've learned about conditionals, loops, lists, strings and turtle.  
I have used:
* conditionals to make tina has different color when writing different tone of poetry  
* loops to deal with inputs  
* lists to save the poetry input  
* strings to deal with lowercase  
* turtle things to write poetry clearly  
* "line" in Python
