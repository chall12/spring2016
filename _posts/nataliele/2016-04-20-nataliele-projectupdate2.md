So I was able to start working on the project by getting all the files I need into Trinket. I also decided on the menu structure that I will use: starting out with individual/small business level, then option to go into state or national level.

Things I was able to achieve:
 
 - [x] clean and attach relevant files into Trinket
   - [x] main files from Kaggle
   - [x] county codes file/json code
 - [x] design menu selection screen
 
 For next Tuesday I will have to ultimately decide what I want the program to be able to do. Do I let users explore the whole dataset or do I read a subset of data into dictionaries and explore from there? Then I will start writing codes for the simple descriptive stats functions for a specific option eg. individual and state level. Then hopefully I can quickly modified that for other options.

 Milestones for next Tuesday:

 - [ ] decide in details what the program will do
 - [ ] descriptive statistics functions for the first option: individual, state level
 
 To do for later:
 
 - [ ] descriptive statistics functions for the rest of the options
 - [ ] stretch: interaction functions (eg. How many plans in NC lower than $100?)
 - [ ] description of the program and the variables available
 - [ ] help menu on buttons and functions
 - [ ] bar charts
 - [ ] transition between functions
 - [ ] clear and reset
