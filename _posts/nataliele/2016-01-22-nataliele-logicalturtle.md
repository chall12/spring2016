I really liked the congratulation screen of the Treasure hunt turtle so my idea for this exercise came from there.

My epiphany for this exercise was the try-except. I thought i have to do it for every time there's a user input. Long story short, it was a fluke that I realized that I could have just one try at the beginning and everything else nested under it. Because:
1. "try" will keep executing until there's an error
2. Basically with any input other than numeric, I can just reply with "Please enter numeric value"

Other small things:
I had some problem with clearing the stamps. The manual said to use tina.clearstamps() but that didnt work for some reason. By chance I figured out tina.clear which works just fine.
There are a couple of fors and ifs. Even though i thought it would be pretty simple, the nests get crowded and thick pretty fast and it was a challenge to remember which nest I was on.
There was a problem when I typed something and it keeps giving me error. Finally I erased it, rewrote it and it worked. +___+

It was great to see I could make an idea come to life!
