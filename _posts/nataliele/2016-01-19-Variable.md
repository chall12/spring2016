This is my variable exercise:

The initial problem I have with this exercise is how to print a string together with the numeric output thatI calculated. I kinda gave up at first but later in class, when we talked about it, I realized that if we can turn a str to an int using int(), we can probably turn an integer back to string. So I tried str() and it worked. I ended up using float() though because i thought it would encompass int and not give an error if the input is float. Also I didnt realized that when we input something, it's stored as a string so we have to convert it into integer.
