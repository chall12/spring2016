I think I'm getting used to doing these exercises and getting a good hang of it by now. Sitting down and really think through what each syntax does has helped tremendously for lists, lists of lists etc. For regex I think I'm still sometimes not sure which character to use. I was also thrown off when I used "From:" instead of "From " so knowing exactly what you're looking for is very important.
