Natalie's reflection:
I was able to do the last part of the exercise thanks to the guidelines explained in class. I realized that i have to exclude the first line otherwise I wont be able to convert the numbers.

After this I still got the same error and that's when I realized there were also a few data points with different formats. This one had " and , and the others didnt have any data so I fixed this and I used the city name for state for others.
