Basically I moved the codes to draw the console background to another module and the codes to repeatedly draw new screens when the Tetris piece moves to another module. I think when I move the codes to repeatedly draw new screen, it makes the program unstable. So you might have to **click "Run" several times for it to display properly** (max I clicked was 8). I think this is because of the random module so you have to click it several times to get a playable version. More in the midterm reflection post.
