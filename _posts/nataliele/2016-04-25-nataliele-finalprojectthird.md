The problem I have now is that most of my codes are now nested under 1 function. I dont think this is a good design but I'm not sure how to take them out without creating global variables because I also read that having global variables is also not a good design. I wonder if there is some way to use method/class like what we did with Turtle?

I will also drop the option to explore the Small Business Health Options Plan and focus on building options for the Individual Plans. Otherwise there will be too many layers and it will be option 1.2.4.1.

Things achieved:
 - [x] clean and attach relevant files into Trinket
  - [x] main files from Kaggle
  - [x] county codes file/json code
 - [x] design menu selection screen
 - [x] state level: highest premium and highest premium for each age group
 - [x] federal level: highest premium and highest premium for each age group

Things to work on for Thursday: 
 - [ ] flesh out other descriptive statistics functions
 
Remaining things to work on:
 - [ ] description of the program and the variables available
 - [ ] help menu on buttons and functions
 - [ ] bar charts
 - [ ] transition between functions
 - [ ] clear and reset
 - [ ] stretch: interaction functions (eg. How many plans in NC lower than $100?)
 - [ ] stretch: linking other tables
