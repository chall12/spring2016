So I'm taking a previous clicky game and adding another level of game play to it. In the first level sharks will appear one by one and users will have to guess the positions and click on them to kill the sharks. In the second level, multiple sharks will move horizontally at different locations. Users will have to use the keyboard to move Tommy across the river without touching the sharks. For the second one I think the concept is similar to how the tetris blocks move down on the screen, only for this it will move horizontally. I'm not sure if I will be able to have them move at different speed though. Having multiple sharks will also be a problem to solve.


 - [x] Screen background
 - [x] import shark image
Shark easy mode:
 - [x] Shark appears one by one randomly in the river and disappears
 - [x] User guesses shark's location, click to move Tommy to the location.
 - [ ] If location is correct, shark is destroyed and count increases
 - [ ] When count reaches 5, switch to another mode
Shark hard mode:
 - [ ] multiple sharks appears
 - [ ] multiple sharks move horizontally 
   - [ ] at different locations
   - [ ] in different directions
   - [ ] at different speed
 - [ ] user moves Tommy to cross the river without touching the sharks
 - [ ] if Tommy touches a shark, mode is reset
 - [ ] count increase 1 point when Tommy passes 1 shark
 - [ ] once points reach 10, Tommy is united with Tina
Code:
 - [ ] functions are separated in different modules
 - [ ] codes are commented
