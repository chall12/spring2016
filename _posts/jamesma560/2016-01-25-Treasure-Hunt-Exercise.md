Reflection:

Firstly, I appreciated the fact that we were provided some starter code for this exercise. The comments were extremely insightful as well.
Based off of my experiences in prior computer science courses, sometimes the most intimidating thing about a project isn't even the 
inherent complexity of the project itself but just a simple blank screen. Kind of like that Spongebob episode where Spongebob can't start 
an essay because he can't get past the act of staring at a blank piece of paper. Now I'm not saying I think every single exercise should 
have starter code, but what I'm saying is having it for this exercise was a welcome change of pace.

One thing I took away from this exercise is how to have a "test" code and a "final" code. I noticed that in your directions, you mandated 
that the winner be decided based off of whether a user could land within 5 units of the random coordinates you picked. But since you set 
the range to be within -100 and 100, this made the "winner" section of my code difficult to see at first. However, by changing the winning
proximity from "5" to "200" I was able to circumvent this.
