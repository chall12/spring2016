Exercise 1 wasn't that hard once I managed to figure out how to describe the last index value in my string using an incrementing count 
variable, because then I could increment count while using it to step back through my string. Didn't have much trouble with exercises 3 and
4. Exercise 5 was a bear though. I ended up having to read over the .find() function over and over to figure out what it actually does so I could
use it affectively. Once I figured out how that all find() really did was return the index of a specified string value, I was able to slice out
 the part of the string I wanted to convert to float and print.
