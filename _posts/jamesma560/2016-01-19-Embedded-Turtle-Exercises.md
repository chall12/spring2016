First I made a robot (with some user input):

Then for my second program I tried to make a cooler robot:

Reflection:

I think the most valuable thing that I learned from these excercises was how to navigate the coordinate system. Drawing robots was advantageous in this regard, because having to repeatedly draw shapes with sides of equal length (rectangles, squares) it forced me to really pay attention to the coordinate system and how it was mapped out. 

With that being said there was more I wanted to include into the second program, but I just wasn't able to get the code to work. For example, I wanted to mess around with the title() method (not sure if "method" is the right word) but couldn't get it to work (I'm guessing I didn't have a certain module but I'm not sure). I'd also be really interested to learn how turtle.py expresses animation. I think that'd be a cool thing to include as well.
