Milestones:

- [] Have the user be able to interact with the screen using the mouse, as opposed to typing input through the bottom screen.
- [] Create and use multiple modules. Have one main.py which references other refactored ".py" scripts. 
- [] Use functions that I haven't used in previous programs
- [] Draw something worth drawing (something aesthetically interesting/pleasing)
- [] Have whatever the user 'draws' change color based off of where they click on the screen. 
- [] Use onkey to draw shapes
- [] use the .tracer() method to enhance my drawing app
- [] Have a random element to the game
