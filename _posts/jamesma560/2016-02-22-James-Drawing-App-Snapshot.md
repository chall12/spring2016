So here is a snapshot of my drawing app. This drawing app is in essence an extension of the robot apps I had made earlier this 
semester. Basically, since I'm not a very artistic person myself, I wanted to make a drawing app that even a child could use. So basically
I envision having a turtle draw en elmo stencil, and then have another turtle (using the .ondrag() method most likely) be available to color 
in the stencil. To control the color, I wanted to use the keys on the keyboard to allow the user to change the color of the "crayon". 

Unfortunately, if you run my code, I have a click_to_draw() function that I want to test the mouses .onclick() capability. But regardless
I can't get the function to activate. That's where I'm stuck at the moment.
