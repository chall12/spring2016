Exercise 1 was a funny one. At first I didn't understand the significance of calling it over and over, and ended up making a list with only 
three elements. So when I would call the chop() function over and over the program would fail because it would run out of 
items to remove. Once I expanded my list though I understood why you wanted us to call it over and over (to see if it was actually
chopping off the first and last elements). As far as the last exercise goes, I was kind of confused because I wasn't sure how to get
a .txt file to work. For some reason when I first tried to click the addition sign in Trinket and added another .txt tab, I got an error
saying that it had to be a .py file. But then when I retried it after your email it worked perfectly. I suppose I had some weird setting
turned on my first run through.
