Still not even close. 

Overall, I'm incredibly disappointed. It's 2:30 in the morning, I've been working on it for days, I'm exhausted, I've literally burnt out my bedroom lightbulb, and it still doesn't work. Quite frankly I'm about ready to throw in the towel and just move on from Turtle for good. I haven't been this mentally frustrated in a long, long time. 

Basically my main problems are as follows:
  
  - Score counter is inconsistent. Bascially my score counter will sometimes increment, but most of the time it just won't. 
  - I also wanted each "basketball" to disappear after a player collected it but I didn't even get close to that. 
  - Can't get the "player_turtle" to successfully collide with the "asteroid_turtle".
  - Everything basically
  -
Those were my main issues, which unfortnately when left unresolved, makes the game pretty much useless.

I guess my main disappointment was that Turtle was a colossal struggle for me all year, but at this point in the semester I really thought I had enough of an understanding to make a fun game. I was completely wrong. This whole Turtle experience has just been rough. 

I'll try and work on it in the morning but I doubt I'll make much progress. 

Milestones: 

-[]	Use a custom class (pass in coordinates, variables, whatever) 
-[]	Use custom methods with those custom class 
-[x] Create screen. 
-[] Fullfill all assignment requirements. 
-[] Include both key and click events. 
-[] Have a .congratulate() that appears when the user wins. 
-[] Have a turtle .write() game instructions to the screen 
-[]	Use a custom turtles to display information to the user 
-[]	Just have good user feedback -[]	Try to implement a loop. 
-[x]	Have a turtle that is controlled by the user’s arrow key. 
-[]	Have a turtle that moves independently of user input. This may be something which the user has to dodge. 
-[] Have a turtle that moves based off of for loop to obtain constant motion. 
-[] Put in condition that prevents infinite loop. 
-[] Have an event triggered when the user controlled turtle intersects with the independtly moving turtle. 
-[x]	Use a method that I have never used before (perhaps .seth() or .towards()) 
-[]	Have an option to reset the game to it’s “starting” state.
-[] Comment on every class and method. •	Stretch milestones 
-[]	Have there be different levels. Higher the level, the more stuff (turtles) the user has to dodge 
-[] Include a story -
-[] Have a “collecting coins” aspect
