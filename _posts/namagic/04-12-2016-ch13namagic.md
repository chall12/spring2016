Besides trinket freezing up, crashing, or timing out, this was interesting. For one, it's fascinating that we can access information so easily from Google. Secondly, I had to take the print results and put into a word document to find out where the various indents were! One thing that continues to trip me up is why I can enter some cities and obtain results but not for others. For instance, I can type in Chapel Hill but not Durham. I can type in my home address but not my zip code because I get an index out of range. I couldn't figure out the pattern of indents for various entries such as Atlantic Ocean or 27713.
