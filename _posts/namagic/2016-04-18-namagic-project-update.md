<h2>Are there any roadblocks ahead? Is there anything your group can do to help out?</h2>

<h3>Snag 1</h3>
For this first update, I wanted to be able to print out inflow and outflow numbers neatly. When a user types in a desired county, the idea was that it would only print out the needed information; however, anytime Orange was typed, it would return every row with Orange in it. I was able to fix that by using two if statements with the words I was seeking that would ensure that no unnessecary data is printed out.

<h3>Snag 2</h3>
I am not sure how to manipulate a csv file to add a column as well as creating a function to subtract or add from different csv files. I couldn't find anything in the python documentation about adding a field. I can see how to add a new row, but not a field. 

<h3>Snag 3</h3>
Since I cannot figure out how to add a new column, I cannot create functions to add newly created fields.

<h2>Are your milestones ambitious enough? Make sure to include some stretch goalst?</h2>
I don't think they're too ambitious yet, but I might have to reevaluate by Thursday. I am behind on my plan though and I haven't fully thought about how to include the top three counties. However I believe I can do that by selecting the three rows under the "County Non-migrants" item. In regards to my own planning, I underestimated the difficulty in writing over a csv file. While the easy way out would be to edit the actual csv file and then read it, but that would defeat the purpose. Had I been able to anticipate this, I might have had more time to actually work on my code.

<h2>Explicitly state what youâ€™re working on next and what you intend to accomplish before next class.</h2>
Before class on Thursday, my goal will be to finish up unfinished milestones that I had planned for Tuesday. Particularly in attemtping to resolve the snags noted above. I might need help though either from my group or more google searching. I think I have to open a csv file in write mode, but when I tried previously, I ended up deleting the information in the csv file.

<h2>Milestones</h2>
