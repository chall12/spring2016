This was actually pretty fun and easy to build. I'm not sure how best to design the code for readability. I need to read more on that. Generally, I think this code is readable; however, I want to be kind to those reading my code. I also learned something new! One way I was able to print each poem line on a separate line, you can use 

"for elem in list"
  print elem
  
On a separate note, I don't know if done is the best way to end the program, what if you want to use done in your poem???
