title: "Omar's Drawing App Peer Review and Self-Reflection"

<h3>The code</h3>
- [x] utilize custom modules for readability and organization
- [x] utilize custom functions for modularity
- [x] utilize multiple turtle objects
- [x] utilize a named screen object
- [x] run without errors
- [x] be well-commented
- [x] be well-organized and readable

<h3>The app</h3>
- [x] entirely graphical user interface
- [x] allows user to select drawing mode that changes program's response to clicks and/or keys
- [x] display current mode and other relevant info to user
- [x] allow user to choose and draw shapes, lines, colors depending upon selected mode
- [x] allow user to clear drawing and start over

<h3>The process</h3>
The milestones were clear, for the most part consisted of the various requirements for the code and app listed above. Ruotong completed all her additional milestones. To make sure that the program functioned as it should, she had to limit what she had done. She wanted to be able to switch the pen and fill color but couldn't get that to work. It did require a bit of key-mashing to figure out how to clear. Different key letters did different things and the app didn't say how to clear the screen.

Also don't fully understand teh functionality and what pressing "f" does?

I did have a similar problem in being able to manipulate multiple screens in an attempt to improve readability. I really liked the use of functions with useful names, made the program far more readable. There was an extra module, shortcut.py, not sure if it was doing anything.

<h3>Self-Reflection</h3>
I liked how she more clearly displayed the mode the user was in by having a turtle write on the screen what mode the user was in. Also, her keyboard mode was better than mine in that it provided smaller moves forward to give the user more control. Also, I didn't realize you could use ondrag to let the user drag and release with the mouse. That would have been useful.
