</h2>Reflection</h2>
I think if anything this project taught me quite a bit about scope. I attempted to create a large project where I would be able to tell the story of the Phantom Tollbooth where at the end Milo would rescue the princesses. Essentially, a game event appears which is an event that occurs in the book.

With such a wide open project, I wanted to be ambitious. At first when developing the app, I focused on the functionality before creating additional game events. However, the functionality took up so much of my time that I never got around to creating the full game. I ended up only getting three functioning events.

There were three things I could not get to work properly. One piece that I couldn’t get to work though was creating a moving turtle that responded to a boundary. I kept getting a ValueError. I also was able to create custom classes; however, after creating them, some of the attributes such as penup or hideturtle didn’t function so I had to include them separately for each additional turtle I made. The last piece I could not get to work was to make a click function work in an if statement. I wanted to call the click function when an argument was True but the click function would not work when part of an if statement.

Generally though I was less frustrated through the development of this app than I was the drawing app. I was better able to debug and fix any errors I had barring the ones noted above.
