This activity was pretty hard. Outside of the first one, I actually couldn't get the rest to work. I frequently received error messages of KeyError which occurs when what I'm trying to grab out of the dictionary isn't actually in the dictionary. Figuring out which item I was looking for was also hard, but I was able to test it out even when I kept getting the KeyError because it would show me the word I attempted to select, but it couldn't print it because it wasn't actually in the dictionary. I think I'm getting confused as to what I'm actually parsing. 

*Note: I didn't finish the last one, will work on it, but it will be late
