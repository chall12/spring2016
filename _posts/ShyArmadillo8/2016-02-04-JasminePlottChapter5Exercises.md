The first exercise wasn't so bad, but I had a really hard time with the second exercise and was unable to completely get it right in the end.  I have it set up so that it identifies the first digit of a number that you put in, but if you put in more than one number, even if the number  starts with a 9 but is smaller, the program spits out that this number is the maximum.  I tried changing the numbas variable I created to float and a variety of other different things that just didn't work.  I'm quite frustrated, since I know that I must be missing something but don't know what it is. Hopefully, I'll be able to figure this out in time.
