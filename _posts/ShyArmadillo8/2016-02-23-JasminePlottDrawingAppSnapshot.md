After a bit of frustration, I have reached a point where I'm okay with my code being at the point that it is.  I'm realized throughout 
creating my code that there are definitely some milestones I made that might be out of reach, but for now, I have figured out ways to adapt
these milestones into more managable goals.  Here are some things that I have done well so far:

- I have been able to get my program to respond to user input through the keyboard
- I have been able to get my program to respond to clicking on the screen
- I have been able to get my program to draw planets on click and change the color and width of the stars that they'll draw
- I have been able to get my program to write instructions and let the user know what mode they are in
- I have been able to get my program to drag the turtle across the screen
- I have been able to click on my draw planets, draw stars, and clear screen mode when they are the first things clicked on

Here are some things that I'm struggling to accomplish:

- I'm having trouble successfully switching between modes, especially if the draw planet mode is clicked initially, nothing else wants to 
happen.  I've tried a couple different strategies, but nothing I've done yet seems to work.
- I need to somehow incorporate a for loop into my program, but I am not sure where this would be appropriate.  I need to 
brainstorm how to do this
- I need to stop my star line from creating abstract shapes and be just a line.  I've played with myscreen.tracer and myscreen.update, but
neither of these methods seems to be helping.

Hopefully, I'll be able to work these things out by Thursday! Here's my snapshot:
