The ultimate vision that I have for my final drawing app project is something like Frogger's Adventures.  For those who aren't very familiar
with Frogger, here is a picture: http://s.emuparadise.org/fup/up/43431-Frogger's_Adventures_-_Temple_of_the_Frog_(U)(Lightforce)-2.png
This may be an overly ambitious endeavor, but as I was watching the different videos, I kept thinking how cool it would be to make a game
like this and be able to incorporate drawing elements into it.  Ideally what I'd want is one turtle that the user would control and 
navigate through the obstacles (sets of moving turtles) on the screen while trying to connect a series of dots that is a "map to the treasure."
Here are some of the milestones that I would need to accomplish in order to make this work:

- [ ] Have the turtle respond to the use of user arrow keys including Down, Up, Left, and Right
- [ ] Call multiple turtles to the screen in specified coordinates as setup for the game
- [ ] Space dots out on the screen that need to be intersected with by Frogger to win the game
- [ ] Play winning animation when all the dots have been touched
- [ ] When I have the multiple turtles on the screen, I want them to move in a certain predetermined pattern in order to make them obstacles
to the main turtle that responds to user input
- [ ] As Frogger connects each dot, change the thickness of the pen that follows behind him to trace his path 
- [ ] As Frogger connects each dot, change the background color of the screen and pen color

These might have to be redone to make them more manageable for the actual assignment, but I'm excited to see whether I can accomplish these
goals.
