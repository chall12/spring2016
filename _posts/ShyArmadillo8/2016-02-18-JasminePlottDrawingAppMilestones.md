New Update:
After talking with Hannah about our milestones and goals for this assignment, I decided that it might be a good idea to rethink my assignment and save my Frogger idea for later when we do more actual game development projects.  What I've decided to do instead is focusing on creating a night sky with shooting stars across it.  The drawing portion of this app will be based on the user drawing a shooting star through the sky, which can vary in width depending on what they want the star to look like.  As the star "shoots" through the sky, I would like to make the flowers glow.

- [ ] Pressing certain keys allows changing the width of the star
- [ ] Allow the user to drag the turtle across the screen to make the shooting star
- [ ] Have the shooting stars clear when the user presses enter
- [ ] Have a setup module that creates a grassy ground and black night sky
- [ ] When the user drags the star across the screen, have the flowers glow

Old Bad Idea:
The ultimate vision that I have for my final drawing app project is something like Frogger's Adventures.  This may be an overly ambitious endeavor, but as I was watching the different videos, I kept thinking how cool it would be to make a game like this and be able to incorporate drawing elements into it.  Ideally what I'd want is one turtle that the user would control and navigate through the obstacles (sets of moving turtles) on the screen while trying to connect a series of dots that is a "map to the treasure." Here are some of the milestones that I would need to accomplish in order to make this work:

- [ ] Have the turtle respond to the use of user arrow keys including Down, Up, Left, and Right
- [ ] Call multiple turtles to the screen in specified coordinates as setup for the game
- [ ] Space dots out on the screen that need to be intersected with by Frogger to win the game
- [ ] Play winning animation when all the dots have been touched
- [ ] When I have the multiple turtles on the screen, I want them to move in a certain predetermined pattern in order to make them obstacles
to the main turtle that responds to user input
- [ ] As Frogger connects each dot, change the thickness of the pen that follows behind him to trace his path 
- [ ] As Frogger connects each dot, change the background color of the screen and pen color

These might have to be redone to make them more manageable for the actual assignment, but I'm excited to see whether I can accomplish these goals.
