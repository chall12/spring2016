This is my chapter 4 turtle exercise:

Reflection: I've tried my first while loop in this exercise so that the user do not need to start from beginning everytime, and I've written two functions, one for setting background color, the other for drawing the face. I have one question that when the function with no argument is written in the main.py, it works well, but if I put it in another page, it will not work. I need to write it as XX(tina).
