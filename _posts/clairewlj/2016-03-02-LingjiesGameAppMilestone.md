title: "Lingjie's Game App Milestones"
---

The game app I want to create is a simple version of Gold Miner. My program will include 2 or more difficulty levels, which user can click screen to choose. And when playing the game, user need to press keys such as "Left" and "Right" to control the directions of the hook/turtle towards gold, and press another key such as "Enter" to let the hook/turtle go for the gold. There will be different size of gold spread on the screen with different values/scores as well as different sizes of barriers. The user should earn enough scores to win the game.

Milestones:
- [ ] Draw background of 2 or more different difficulty levels of gold mine.
- [ ] Draw different sizes of gold and barriers on the screen.
- [ ] Write functions related to change game mode
- [ ] Write functions related to screen.onkey for controling directions of hook/turtle (Maybe) to change speed
- [ ] Write functions related to change scores according to user's gold mining result
- [ ] Write congratulating function
- [ ] Maybe: add other objects with different effects on the game, such as a "Surprise Bag" to gain extra score or get nothing, or a "Time+" to gain extra time to play the game. 
- [ ] Maybe: add timer to limit the time user has to gain enough score.
