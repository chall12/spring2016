title: "Lingjie's Open Source Contribution"
---

I have to say first that the content of work related to open source contribution are far more diversified than I thought before. I was expecting some difficult tasks about fixing bugs that I could not even understand the description of them. But then I found https://developer.mozilla.org and https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute, where exist multiple tasks require skills including programming, marketing, translation, etc. Apart from the tasks related to coding, which will be quite helpful to push me to keep learning programming, I'm also quite interested in translating documents and writing promotion articles in my languange, which I've done plenty during my internship 2 years ago. Anyway, for now I just complete a beginner's task, https://oneanddone.mozilla.org/tasks/14/, which asks me to create a bugzilla account and post the link, which is a preliminary step to working with bugs. I think I'll keep searching for suitable tasks and make my contribution.
