I want to write a HELLO WORLD on the screen, which seems to be tradition for beginners in coding. I used raw_input & forward & goto mostly, and I'm glad that
I also learned how to draw a semi-circle during the process, but I'm still wondering how to change the direction of drawing a circle.
Also, the screen was a little small so I had to change the length of distance to include all the letters.
