This is my clicky Turtles exercise:

Reflection: I'm trying to draw eyes looking at wherever the user click and whose color varies according to the distance from the treasure. I learned a lot from the exercise, and I indeed still have some problems working on this exercise. First of all, it seems that the function of tina.clear() can not work to clear drawings done in other functions called. I think I'll try again later. Another is about the color, if I put the functions of changing eye color in another module instead of in the main.py, they will not work. Also, I think I'll need to try to add a loop in the program. And I still have a seemingly easier questions about how to move the turtle faster than the largest speed(10).
