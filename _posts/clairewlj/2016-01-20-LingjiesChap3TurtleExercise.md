Reflection:
I just made the famous face of who I believe we all know - although I'm not sure if he had a moustache or not. I enjoyed the process, but I had trouble calculating the exact degree of angle when drawing the moustache. I tried - though asked not to - the math function of sqrt(), but there was still something wrong and the moustache was a little askew on the screen. I hope there will be some solutions to solve the problem.
