This is my treasure hunting program:

Reflection: I basically want to create a endless game providing infinite chances to play again. And I choose to tell the player the treasure's location using eight directions such as north, south, east and west. In the process, I made the same mistake again - forgeting that the "equals to" operator is "==" instead of "=". I think I'll remember it after this homework since I spent quite some time before I finally found it.
