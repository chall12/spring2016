Reflection:

I wanted to create a program where users can drag the different eyebrows, mouth, and eyes to the face. However, I can not figure out how to drag things. So, instead, I ask users to click on the eyebrows, mouth, and eyes, and a turtle will draw the features onto the face. I noticed that storing the turtle's finish location is very important when designing the background of the game. To do so, I created a list called positions to store the locations. I have not yet draw the eyes and the colors of the glasses. Those will be finished on Wednesday.

List of things I want to discuss:

First, I want to discuss the techniques of drawing oval. 
Second, I want to discuss the probability of using keyboard to control color choice. 
Third, I want to discuss if there is a way to "drag" things on the screen.
