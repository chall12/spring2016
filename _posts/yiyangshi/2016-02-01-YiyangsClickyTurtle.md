Reflection:
1. If I need to define a variable outside a function but to use the variable inside the function, I can use "Global" command.
2. I can use quit() to exit a program.
3. There are two places that I want to improve in the future. One, I want to make the added happy score different for the four animations and may even include tasks that make tina less happy. Two, I want to improve the button. I want to make the button 3D and users can "actually" click it.
