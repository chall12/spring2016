TriPython – Durham Project Night

April 18th at Durham

On April 18th, I went to the Durham Project Night organized by TriPython. This is the first time that I went to a project night and I got a lot of things done there during that time! The meetup was very casual where people can just come and work on their own project. People can leave anytime they want as well. It was quiet during the whole event and there were very few conversations between people. However, knowing that you are sitting together working with python users, you feel comfortable, motivated, and supported. I found that I can easily dive into programming during the time and I was much more productive there than programming by myself at home. 

One thing that I felt awkward at the event was that I didn’t know when to interrupt people and ask questions. People were either typing or looking blankly and you can tell that they were thinking some serious programming questions. I know how I don’t like to be stopped halfway in programming so I really couldn’t find a good time to pull people out from their project. Other than that, I really like the project night and I would definitely considering going again to get things done.
