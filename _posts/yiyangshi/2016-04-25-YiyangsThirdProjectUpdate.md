title: "Yiyang's Third Project Update"
---
Here is the program:
https://github.com/yiyangshi/FinalProject

Up to this point, the most part of the project is done. I ended up making five functionalities instead of three, which reflected an unclear view at the very beginning. Then writing the code for various functions, I took a lot of time thinking about who my users will be and what kind of information they would be interested in getting out of this little "App". If I have thought this through more clearly at the beginning, the coding would be more smooth.

So far, the functionalities are done. I have also added a bar chart into the program. However, the bar chart is not well legended yet. I plan on improving the visualization more. I also will allow users to upload their own files. And, most importantly, clean up the codes. Looking ahead, I would not go for the strech goals but just make my current program nicer.


Milestones:

For Tuesday:

- [x] Configure PyCharm. Clean and upload the large database into PyCharm.
- [x] Write function that take carrier name as input and calculate the max, mean, and min delay time for the carrier.
- [x] Write function that take carrier name as input and calculate the top delay reasons and corresponding delay time for the carrier. 
- [x] Do step 2 and 3 again for the airports.


For Thursday:

- [x] Write function to calculate the top 10 carriers that are most likely to delay.
- [x] Write function to calculate the average delay time for different day of week. 


For Tuesday:

- [x] Write function to calculate the top airports that have high delay time due to weather or other reasons. 
- [x] Run the above codes on data of another month.
- [x] Build visualization on the top 10 carriers
- [x] Build user interface. Allow users to choose between the three functionality.
- [x] Create Help Functions
- [x] Improve the program. Creat "graceful" error message and quit option.


To Be Scheduled:

- [ ] Improve visualization.
- [ ] Allow users to upload their files.
- [ ] Debug. 


Strech Goals:

- [ ] Maybe use turtle to create line graph.
- [ ] Make the program into an "App"-like program. Make it fun.
