Reflection:
I think the exercises really helped me understand the different applications of dictionary. It can be used for counting frequence, finding specific informations, finding maximum, etc. I am especially surprised by how easy it is to use the dictionary to find the email address that sends email the most. I am still a little rust on special characters. I guess I just need more exercises in order to remember all the special characters.
