Here is my posted issue:
https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/6344

I found that matplotlib is an open source project on Github. There are a lot of posted issues and pull requests. So I decided to explore the project. I tried to install the project on Linux system following the installation write up on the project. But I got errors with both Python 2.7 and Python 3. Please check the link above for detailed write up.
