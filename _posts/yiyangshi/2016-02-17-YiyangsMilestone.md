I would like to create a face drawing game. An empty face with glasses will be on the background. User will choose from a list of eyebrows, mouths, and eyes to draw on the face. User can also choose the colors of the glass frame. 

Milestone:

- [ ] Draw the empty face background.
- [ ] For each facial feature, draw three choices.
- [ ] Create a hiden turtle that draws user's choice on the empty face.
- [ ] Draw color scale on the screen for user to choose.
- [ ] Color the glassframe.
- [ ] Limit user to only pick one choice for each facial feature.
