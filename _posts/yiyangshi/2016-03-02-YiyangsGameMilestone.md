I would like to create a game that is similiar to Angry Bird. Users use birds, in this case angry turtles, to target and shoot stacked ice. I would like the users to be able to change the target direction using keyboard, and change the shooting speed of the angry turtles using click. If I have time, I will create different turtle modes that user can choose using click and change speed control to keyboard since its more intuitive. Below are my milestones.

Milestones:

- [ ] draw shooting barrel and ice stack
- [ ] link shooting barrel with keyboard control. Make shooting barrel rotate by clicking "Up" or "Down"
- [ ] make turtle move along the direction of the shooting barrel in straight line
- [ ] make turtle move along the direction of the shooting barrel in parabola
- [ ] define "hitting the target"
- [ ] make the game delete one ice when the user hit the ice stack
- [ ] link shooting speed with click. 
- [ ] create "Win" animation

Optional Milestones:

- [ ] make a welcoming manual
- [ ] create turtles with different mode 
- [ ] allow clicking to choose turtle modes and change speed control to keyboard control.
