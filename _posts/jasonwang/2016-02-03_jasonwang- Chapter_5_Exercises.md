Exercise 1:

I initially was attempting to solve the problem without using lists, but broke from the temptation and decided to use them. I knew that Matlab had a method in which you could concatenate additional objects to a matrix, so I investigated the python version, which is the MatrixName.extend() function. 
Mildly surprised that I can simply state what things I should concatenate onto my matrix through a function, rather than the Matlab way.
I also discovered the "sum" function for lists, which greatly simplified how I would go about calculating the totals.
For the "count", a simple counter was established. Not really intended as most counters, but still good.

I realized I could use most of the same code from the first exercise. I actually accidentally discovered the max and min functions - I was first attempting to name the variable "max" and "min", but I noticed the different font colors.
The max() and min() functions also work the same method as the sum() function, while the calculation of the average remained the same.

At least I have a newfound appreciation of lists now.
