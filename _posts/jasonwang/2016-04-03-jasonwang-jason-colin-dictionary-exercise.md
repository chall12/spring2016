## Reflection
This set of exercises was more difficult than other ones we've worked on as pair programmmers. I think mostly because we hadn't read the chapter before getting started. We spent a lot of time not really understanding why what we did wasn't working. Most of those mistakes were small errors like not understanding the formatting of puting a dictionary inside a dictionary or how to access a key inside a key. When we first built our dictionary inside a dictionary it seemed like it was working, but it turned out we had actually nested it inside another dictionary. So there were three levels. This made it very difficult to figure out how to write values to it or pull values from it. Turns out that happened because we used curly braces instead of brackets in one place. Woops.
We figured it out.
