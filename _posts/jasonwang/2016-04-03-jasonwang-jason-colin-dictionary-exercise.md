The exercise was trickier than what we were used to. The biggest issue we had was with the dictionary of dictionaries, as it was hard to envision at first. However, realizing that we could use our result from the last section's list to narrow down the list of states was useful, and shortened what we needed to do. The try/except case was needed as we were getting an error when running the term "Price" through the int() function, so we needed to explicitly make a case to ignore the header.
