Exercise #1:

Not too bad. I initially misinterpreteted the overtime difference to mean that the wage for the entire time has a 1.5 multiplier, but I realized that it only applied to the actual overtime period.
Also, I recognize that my usage of the hournew variable was a little patchy. I feel like definitely there's a better solution, but I can't think of it at the moment.

Exercise #2:

The try/except framework was relatively easy to implement, but I still initially put the entire if/else conditionals outside of the block. Should've gone inside.

Exercise #3:

Fairly straightforward from the exercise 2, but I would like to explain that I used the absolute value to also account for negative scores. Also, the elseif conditional is a beautiful thing to use indeed.
