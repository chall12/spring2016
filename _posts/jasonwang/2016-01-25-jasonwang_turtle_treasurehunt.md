Thoughts:

It was a nice exercise for understanding loops, especially the notion of breaking out of a loop. I decided to make it more of a challenge to win by taking the direct distance (resulting in a circle of possibilities), rather than giving the number of steps in X/Y axes.
I originally had the program use the break function (which it still can), but I decided that still_going should probably be used and set up an "if" statement.
There was a bit where I was getting inconsistancies in how the winning case is detected with the notification that your guess was too large, but that was rectified by removing the break statement.
