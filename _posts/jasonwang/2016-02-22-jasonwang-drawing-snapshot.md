Still a bit of a ways to go. I managed to set up a system for pressing numbers for selecting colors, and have a rough idea on what to do for selecting shapes.
However, I currently am still thinking about how exactly I need to leave shapes on the drawing canvas. I also still need to create a method of deciding line thicknesses.

There is a lot of copy-and-pasting in this draft, but I will eventually get around to cutting them down with loops. However, I was wondering if it was possible to drag and click with the modules that we currently have available, much like conventional drawing apps.
I was also wondering if there is a way to isolate areas of the screen to update/ leave permanently. I realized that it may be difficult to implement to implement a background theme without wiping previous work that was done.
