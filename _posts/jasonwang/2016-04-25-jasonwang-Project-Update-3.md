## Milestones
- [x] Multiple Data Files.
- [ ] Generalizable to a class of data files. (Sort of have?)
- [x] Text-based.
- [ ] Method of calling a "help" function.
- [ ] Iterative Interface. (While loop)
- [x] Include code in public github repo (Cloud 9)
- [x] Text printouts of data
- [ ] Function that opens user's imported file upon request.
- [x] Function that creates horizontal histogram for comparing rating distribution.
- [x] Function that creates horizontal histogram for comparing Comment distribution.
- [x] Function that creates a line graph for modeling how the video viewcount changes over time.
- [ ] Function to allow the user to exit the program if desired.
- [x] Create a function to determine the overall growth of view count (beginning crawl vs. ending crawl) and rank appropriately.
- [x] Use video ID's from determining top 10 and bottom 10 view count growth rates and graph selected videos.
- [x] Make dictionary of video ID's as keys, and view count as the data.
- [x] Make dictionary of video ID's as keys, and average rating as the data.
- [x] Make dictionary of video ID's as keys, and comment count as the data. 

## Stretch Milestones
- [ ] Integrate youtube API
- [ ] Collect current view count rates of popular videos and compare to data set.
- [ ] Regression analysis for determining type of growth.

I've gotten all of the actual data analysis parts done, and only have the infrastructure part to complete, as well as formatting the outputs so that they're readable. Currently there aren't any major roadblocks, so it should be smooth-ish sailing from here. I am, however, aware that the UI part will take up a lot of time, and will need a lot of testing to search for bugs.

I broke up the milestones regarding the histograms; I realized that there wasn't a good method of comparing rating with comments, so I decided to plot the distribution of ratings and comments separately. Video rate doesn't seem to be that important, so I will omit it for now. Besides that milestones, the milestones that I set were completed, and only have the general milestonres left. There currently isn't any progress on the stretch milestones, however.

I believe I'll be able to keep to the plan, as it is primarily formatting and UI things. I've made sure to give myself much more realistic goals for the time that I had this time around, so progress is comfortable, for once.
