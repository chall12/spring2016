##Overall Goal

Using some kind of theme, create a Microsoft-Paint-esque script that allows the user to select line thicknesses and change colors when drawing. There will be two drawing modes: one for free drawing, and one where the user is constrained to a certain area. During reset, the screen should not have to redraw everything.
