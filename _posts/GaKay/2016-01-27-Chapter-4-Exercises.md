Reflection:
I thought this assignment wasn't too bad since we already had most of the code done from previous exercises. I think I'm beginning to understand functions a bit more. I can see how they could be very useful. Since I have never messed with functions before, this concept is still a little fuzzy to me, but I think with more practice, I'll be able to get a better handle on it.
