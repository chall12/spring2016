Reflection:
This exercise did not take me as long as I thought it would, which helped reassure me that I understood some of these concepts better than I thought. After I was able to get my initial code working, I decided to add a few features to make my trinket even better. I have a setup function that changes the background color and writes a message at the top of the screen. I also an if statement to account for users who might continue writing messages that go off of the screen. With the way I have my fonts set up, the user can only write 18 lines worth of text. If the user goes past that, they will get a message telling them they've reached the limit.
