Reflection:
So far, I thought this assignment has been the most challenging since it was so open-ended. My trinket used a lot of if else statements, and I quickly found out that indents in python are very important when it comes to these types of statements. I would get errors that line ### didn't match up with any indent so I had to figure out how to fix that. Since I had a lot of if else statements, it could get pretty confusing trying to find my place among the code but having all of the statements really helped me get a better understanding on how to use them effectively.
