Reflection:
Once I completed this assignment, I noticed how I was able to do things more efficiently with the use of functions. I didn't have to write out all the code to make two houses or to make all the clouds. When I was first making my clouds, I had the cloud drawing function draw just the cloud and I had the goto function tell Tina where to make the clouds. I noticed that this was very tedious and annoying to do for every single cloud I wanted to make. I then realized that I could use the random function and have Tina choose a random location within a certain space on the interface to make the cloud. This made it much easier to work with. I also added a loop in my code for the cloud making process that way if I wanted to change the number of clouds that were created, I only had to change one number.
