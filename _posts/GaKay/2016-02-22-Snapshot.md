Reflection: This assignment is definitely a bit frustrating especially since some of the functions are a bit newer to me. I finally figured out how to get the colors to change for the free draw mode, but I haven't quite figured out the shapes part yet. I also need to add more instructions and a way to choose between the two modes I'm aiming to create (free draw mode and a shapes mode). Overall, I want feedback on how it runs for the user. I know that I need to add specific instructions on how things are laid out, but I just want to make sure it's not too confusing for the user.
