Reflection:
I thought these exercises were more complex than the other exercises we've done. For exercise 1, I initially had trouble trying to work out the math to be right. I stepped away from it and continued doing the other exercises. I came back to it later and was able to figure it out. For exercise 3, I had to keep going back and changing my code to account for values outside of the range. For example, I had to put an upperbound and lowerbound for each of the numbers just to be sure that a number outside of the range would print an error message instead of a letter grade. Overall, I thought these exercises were fun and helped build my knowledge of python a bit more.
