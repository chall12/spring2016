Reflection:
Overall, I didn't think these assignments were too difficult. I had some issues here and there, but I was able to resolve them. One issue I had was with exercise 3. I was a little confused on the wording of the prompt, but after sending some emails, I was able to get a better understanding of what the prompt was asking for. I also had another issue with exercise 4. At first, I didn't set "sub" equal to any value so my code didn't work. I messed around with it some more and was able to figure it out.
