Reflection:
At first, this assignment confused me a bit, but in the end, I didn't think it was too bad. I tried to use a for loop, but I was unable to get that to work. I know I had the issue of when your input gave more than one location so to get around this problem, I used an if-else statement so that if there was more than one result, it would ask you for a more specific input. I think one thing that made this exercise difficult was the fact that it was hard to read the inital set of results.
