Reflection:
Overall, I thought that these exercises helped solify my understanding of dictionaries a bit more. They are definitely a very new concept for me, but I can see how they can be very useful. For exercise 1, I couldn't figure out how to remove the "\n" character that pops up behind some of the words. I tried to rstrip the character but that didn't seem to work. For exercises 2-5, it took me a while to figure out the first part and make sure that I was able to pull the right strings out, but after I was able to figure that out, it made the rest of the exercises much easier.
