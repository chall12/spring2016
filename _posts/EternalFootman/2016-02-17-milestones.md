For this project, I will attempt to recreate the croquet game from _Alice In Wonderland_. The goal will be to move the hedgehog by arrows
through the wickets. One mode will be normal croquet lawn colors and rules, with the turtle drawing a plain brown line. The other mode will be random colors of background and turtle, changing when a wicket is reached.

- [] Setup module (meadow, characters)
- [] Functions module
- [] Characters module (hedgehogs)
- [] Normal croquet mode (move hedgehog to numbered wickets in order and spacing as in an ordinary game)
- [] Wonderland mode (wickets are placed at random and may disappear and reappear without warning)
- [] Open with text from book introducing game. Perhaps 'Do you play croquet?' with mode options
- [] Possibly include 'Off with your head' surprise ending
- [] Have hedgehog path stay on screen to create abstract art
- [] Create winning sequence
- [] Add comments for context
