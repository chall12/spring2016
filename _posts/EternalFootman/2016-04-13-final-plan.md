title: "Kit's Final Project Plan"

For this project, I will take all of the Lewis Carroll games that I’ve written in Turtle over the semester and combine them into one long, multi-step game. The order will be chronological rather than based on difficulty, which is in keeping with the often nonsensical nature of the source material (this is why I hesitate to call them levels). The different types of games and the variation in complexity will keep the whole thing interesting. If I have time, I will add another level; I like the idea of a quiz on the events in The Walrus and the Carpenter, and this would give me the opportunity to write a text-based game. Most of the games are interactive (some more than others), but I also have a chessboard that I will set to play out the moves in *Through the Looking-Glass*. This might go as a lead-in to the end screen (I’d rather like put it between games to demonstrate progress, but that is much more complicated).

So far, the transitions between levels and menus and such have been the most difficult code to write properly; this is why my starting plan is to get that functional before adding more material. I expect it to be somewhat frustrating for a while. The Croquet and Yarn games already have some simple help dialogue, so I can expand upon that and add it to the others. I'm not sure what to use for the text file; can that be a dictionary? If so, it could be a set of colors that respond to user input. As far as improving the existing segments goes, that will involve more work as I go back - Daisies was written in the first week or two, so the code could definitely use some attention.

I'm actually quite excited about this project. I've wanted to go back and fix my earlier work for some time, and connecting all of the projects will allow me to see how much progress I've made over the semester. I'm also a little concerned, as the particular type of coding involved is almost exclusively that which has given me the most trouble in the past, but that's how character development happens. It would be boring if I knew just how to do everything.

**Milestones:**

-	[ ] Improve Daisies
-	[ ] Improve Croquet
-	[ ] Improve Yarn
-	[ ] Improve Garden
-	[ ] Set moves in Chessboard
-	[ ] Write start screen. Not menu (games will be chronological)
-	[ ] Go through all games to make sure that there are no overlapping turtle names
-	[ ] Write transition between first two games
-	[ ] Apply transition to other games
-	[ ] Incorporate help dialogue
-	[ ] Add custom images, probably transitional screens
-	[ ] Write end screen. Nothing so unambiguous as winning. There will be an imported image of a crown.
-	[ ] Include restart option in end screen

**Stretch Goals:**

-	[ ] Add new section – Walrus and Carpenter quiz
-	[ ] Incorporate chessboard into transition screens to show progress
