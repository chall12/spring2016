Figuring out the absolute value part of the first excercise was more exciting for me than it should have been. That was the point at which I actually understood precisely what was happening; it was lovely.
One question: When I print a variable, a space appears between in and the next character; this is not elegant for punctiation. As it is, I've structured my sentences around it, but how can I put a period or comma directly after a variable? It's bothering me.
In general, these excercises were satisfying; perhaps it was the fruit theme.
