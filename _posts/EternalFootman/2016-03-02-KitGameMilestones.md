This game will be based on the first chapter of _Through the Looking-Glass_, in which Alice attempts to wind a ball of yarn but is interrupted by her cats.

__Milestones:__

- [ ] Create background that resembles a sitting room, possibly using an imported image.
- [ ] Create Alice turtle (probably blue). She will be the active character.
- [ ] Make Alice respond to keyboard arrows.
- [ ] Create a class for the cat objects. They will be the same shape (turtles or possibly imported images) but different colors and, ideally, different sizes.
- [ ] Name three cats. Dinah is large and black, Snowdrop is small and white, and Kitty is small and black.
- [ ] Design an object to represent the ball of yarn. It will be a gray circle.
- [ ] Make the cats move randomly.
- [ ] Make yarn move when cats intersect with it, leaving string train (yarn.pendown).
- [ ] Have the yarn spawn smaller gray circles and leave them behind.
- [ ] Have a way for Alice to wind the yarn again, possibly using yarn.clear (individual clears for the spawned balls).
- [ ] Have a counter for the number of yarn balls picked up.
- [ ] Trigger winning sequence when counter reaches 10 (or whatever number seems to best fit the game).
- [ ] Design winning sequence in separate module.
- [ ] Optional: Give user the option to restart the game.
