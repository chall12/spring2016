The first question had some similarities with the last regex exercise, which demonstrated how dictionaries and lists are related and can sometimes serve the same purpose. The more complex problems, specifically the dictionaries-within-dictionaries, higlighted the differences. I'm just beginning to understand how they work; I think Will (who did most of the more difficult coding) has a better grasp of it, and seeing how he worked out the problems really helped. The last question, where we ask for user input regarding which table to use, tied back into the familiar code from many weeks ago; this keeps everything in context (so it feels as though we're adding to our knowledge rather than just replacing it with the new chapter).
