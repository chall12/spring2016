I'm actually not displeased with the current status of the project. It does approximatly what I want it to do, though I may add another random element to the Wonderland mode (perhaps another ball that rolls through shouting 'off with your head' or some such.

My main concern is the organization of the code. It all works, but I don't like the mass of text in the functions module. The problem was that I could not get the transitions to run properly otherwise. The modes started up well enough, but clear and reset would only work if they were in the same module as the function that they were erasing. Separating it all out made the text and setup overlap; the new stuff came in, but the old did not disappear. It's not a dealbreaker of an issue, as the code does run fine as it is, but I'd like it to be more organized. More to the point, I don't understand why this happens (or does not happen).
