Here are Tina's desert adventures.

And here is a game of turtle checkers.

This one involved a lot of repetition, interspersed with turning back and forth to make sure everything faced in the correct direction.
Below is the code that made one row of pieces (there may be a far more efficient method, but this worked eventually).

```
tina.stamp()
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(100)
tina.right(90)
tina.stamp()
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(100)
tina.right(90)
tina.stamp()
tina.left(90)
tina.forward(100)
tina.right(90)
tina.stamp()
```

I had some difficulty making a proper board; ideally, the squares will alternate in color. Any thoughts on how to accomplish this?
The next step would be to play out a game, but I'm also not sure how to erase a stamp so the piece can 'move' to a different square.
