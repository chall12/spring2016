For the first excercise, I was puzzled by the direction to return 'None'. Is that just deleting the whole list? If so, what is the purpose of removing parts of it?
For both chapters 6 and 8, I found the 'Automate the Boring Stuff' reading to be helpful. Even when the information is essentially the same, reading it in a different form can clarify the confusing parts and reiterate some that slipped through the cracks the first time. This is enough like learning a new language, or at least a new grammar, that repetition is useful.
