This exercise gave me more practice with conditional statements and loops. The one frustration I faced was messing up the distance formula early on. I managed to find this error by printing out the actual coordinates of the treasure as well as the distance that the formula was calculating. I noticed that even if i entered the exact coordinates of the treasure, the distance was still far off which allowed me to deduce that there must have been an error with the formula.
