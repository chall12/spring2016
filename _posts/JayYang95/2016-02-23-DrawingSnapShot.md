This program allows to user to choose a few different modes, including circles, squares, triangles, lines, and color. Upon clicking on the color mode, a new interface will appear where the user can choose from a few colors to change the "pencil" into. Once the user chooses a color, the original interface will pop back up and the user will then have to select a mode again. A clear button is also included. Something I was not able to do was have the program retain which mode it was in (square, circle, line, or triangle) before it had switched to color mode. Thus, the user has to reselect the mode after changing the color.
