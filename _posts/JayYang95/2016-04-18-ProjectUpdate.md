Last Week's Milestones:

 - [ ] Clean, readable code
 - [ ] Use of a text file with difficulty settings and other settings
 - [ ] Sleeker UI
 - [ ] Restart function
 - [ ] Help dialogue
 - [ ] Players start with a number of lives
 - [ ] Keep track of game state in dictionary (lives, level, difficulty)
 - [ ] Add more enemy turtles with increasing dificulty
 - [ ] Use of imported images (maybe)
 - [ ] Pause/resume function
 

I started out by redesigning user interface. I replaced the options on the top that originally allowed the user to change the difficulty (since that will now automatically increase as the player progresses) with a help button and a restart button. The buttons have a thicker outline and are colored in with a light color to make them more visualy pleasing. Although I am still working on making the states of turtle more manageable so that a restart function can be implemented easily, I have created the overall framewok of the code to (hopefully) let the user pause/resume the game at will. This has yet to be tested since the turtles are not done. Overall, I feel that the milestones I have set for myself are reachable and I have added a couple stretch milestones.

Stretch goals:

 - [ ] Improve enemy turtle AI 
 - [ ] Have power-ups that player can pick up or extra lives
 
Goals for Tuesday:

 - [x] Pause/resume function
 - [x] Sleeker UI
 - [x] Help dialogue
 
Goals for Thursday:

 - [ ] Have a text file containing settings
 - [ ] Create a dictionary of game states (current level/difficulty, # of lives, # of enemies)
 - [ ] Cleanly manage states of turtles so that restart function can reset these states
 - [ ] Add more enemy turtles
