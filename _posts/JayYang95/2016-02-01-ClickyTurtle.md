In this program, I created 4 quadrants which would each perform different functions if the user clicked in them. Instead of importing just the setup function from animations, I imported all of its functions since most of my functions were located within animations. This exercise, then, gave me more practice with using functions from other classes. I initially wanted to have the 4th quadrant completely terminate the program and disable the onclick event, but I could not figure out how to do that so I just made the 4th quadrant perform another function. Overall I found this exercise fun and challenging.
