It took me a while to finally find something that I was able to contribute towards, since many projects had levels of coding beyond my level, or I didn't know exactly how to use the apps to test them. I came across the project "alex" which checks if a file or string has offensive/profane language in it. I also saw that Omar had also submitted an issue for this project. With all the controversy of HB2 in North Carolina, I was reminded of the discrimination that transgender individuals face daily and decided to check if alex covered some offensive transgender terms. I found that although alex did mark "tranny" as offensive, it did not cover "shemale" and "he-she", both of which I thought were equally offensive, so I submitted an issue regarding this.

To make sure that alex was working as intended, I first ran the example used in the readme and got the exact same output. Then, I made my own input with the offensive terms and saw alex overlooked them. This is shown in the issue I submitted:
