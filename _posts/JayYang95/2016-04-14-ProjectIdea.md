For my final project, I decided I would be remaking my original Turtle game. The new version will include bug fixes and a sleeker UI along with several added features. I will probably completely recode the program and use the old one as a template in order to create more readable code and manage the states of variables better. Some new added features will include replayability(restart), a set number of player lives, and increasing difficulty as the player progresses.

Milestones:

 - [] Clean, readable code
 - [] Use of a text file with difficulty settings and other settings
 - [] Sleeker UI
 - [] Use of imported images
 - [] Restart function
 - [] Help dialogue
 - [] Possibly a pause/resume function
 - [] Player starts with number of lives
