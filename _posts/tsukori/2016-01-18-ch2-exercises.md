Reflection: I learned that when using the input function it accepts the input as a string so you have to classify the datatype on the input call and not on the variable name. I also learned that you can't concatenate different datatypes unless you separate them with commas. Python is pretty cool overall though, much less typing compared to java thanks to not needing so many semicolons. I forgot how to comment out chunks of code so I just had to copy and paste them onto a notepad.
