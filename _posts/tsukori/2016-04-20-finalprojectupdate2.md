So I managed to get a lot more done than I expected, I took a nap earlier today and woke up and I was like "you know what you can get all of this done and more so you should just get it done." Since my last update I've decided that I want the player to always start at the base level and work their way up, but I won't make the requirements excruciatingly difficult to achieve. My next idea for the score system is to give them more score points based on how well they have performed so far, so they get more points the less strikes they have. This way, if a player is good they can quickly advance to higher levels. 

The repetitive code is becoming a problem and it is really starting to clutter up my modules, so I will definitely be needing to refactor my code a lot either now or a little farther down the line. I'm mostly concerned about creating some big bug if I do that so I'm sort of hesitant, but it's probably for the best if I do it now rather than later. 

Over the weekend I have a paper and another programming assignment for another class due so I don't know how much work I will be putting into this, but I want to get the level system down at the very least. The thing with the level system is, I have to rework how the words are revealed as well as how the blanks are drawn, which may or may not be as much of a hassle as I am making it out to be in my brain. 

Functionality Milestones: 

 - [x] Allow user to click on keys on the screen
 - [x] Give points to user for guessing words correctly
 - [ ] Allow user to enter their own word list
 - [ ] Create 3 different difficulty levels 
 - [ ] Improve on screen text to be more descriptive and helpful to the user
 - [ ] Increase difficulty based on score 
 
 Visual Milestones: 
 
 - [x] Change the color of keys when they are pressed
 - [ ] Make completion screen more exciting by importing outside images
 - [ ] Improve user interface with more drawings
 
Since I've finished the earlier parts of my plan I was planning on deleting them from the list but I'll just strike them out instead. I looked up the markdown code for it so hopefully it works. I've also combined my last and 4th plan points from last time since I've decided to do that. 
 
~~1. Think out changes, start planning them with pseudo code and concepts~~
~~2. On screen click keys that change color~~
~~3. Implement score system~~
 4. Implement level system, with ramping difficulty
 5. Update on screen text to include more information
 6. Unique screens for levels and end score
 7. End game animations for 4 different score ranges
 8. Allow user to import words
