So my paint app is really basic right now and it's about where I want it to be, I plan on working on it more after I submit this pull request. I'm not sure how feasible all of my milestones are so I have moved more of them into my "Optional goals" set, but I definitely want to tackle as many of them as I can. I need to move things into

Basic Milestones:

- [x] selection of drawing mode using clicks and/or keys
- [ ] displays current mode/relevant information
- [x] clear the drawing and start over

Specific Milestones:

- [x] Basic drawing functionality and interface
- [ ] Add colors and brush sizes
- [ ] Add basic stamps (circles, squares, etc)
- [ ] Modularize code for cleanliness and ease of reading

Optional goals:

- [ ] background color selection
- [ ] "erase" functionality
- [ ] color mixing 
- [ ] Add at least 2 different brush types
- [ ] Add at least 2 "special" stamps 
- [ ] Add fill function for shapes
