Exercise 4: <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/06042bfcab" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Our list gave us troubles since it added every instance of the word even though our logic was right, but we found out it was because we were checking to see if the entire list was in our main list, so we fixed that problem and our list worked fine.

Exercise 5: <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/1c80c889b2" width="100%" height="356" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Exercise 5 was the most straightforward and it took us pretty much no time at all.

Exercise 6: <iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python/8c4f97e4b1" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Class ended before we could finish exercise 6 but we worked on it afterwards and it's working as intended. It catches bad input such as strings.
