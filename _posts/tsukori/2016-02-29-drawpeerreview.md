title: "Ga Kay's Drawing App Peer Review"
---

The App: Ga Kay's app does everything the project wanted it to. It's very clean and user friendly. I liked that she actually used the turtle shapes to do the drawing and the drag-to-draw function was cool, I should have done that with my project. She used both clicks and mouse keys so props to her. Her choices for the colors to draw with were great. She came up with a cool way to do backgrounds that I wish I would have done. 


The Code: Her code is organized really well, the functions have descriptive names and she commented to make sure all of her code blocks could be easily understood by someone else. I noticed that she also made a class called TurtleColor to create all of her color turtles so it would be easy to click them and change the color of the pen line. From her snapshot to her final code she cut one of the modules out and gave her project functionality. 


The Process: I couldn't find Ga Kay's initial milestones but her final milestones were standard, she looked at the assignment and created milestones to achieve each of the tasks given to us. Her snapshot did not have any functionality but it showed a lot of the code she started working on, a lot more than I can say. I can see how she's changed her functions and general method for tackling the project. She had a clear concept of what she wanted to do and she did not let anything get in her way. 


Self-reflection: For my drawing project I kept everything to one screen and let the mode selection be controlled without having to clear everything. My shapes did not turn out nearly as well as Ga Kay's and I kind of like her general interface better as well, it just looks much cleaner. I separated my codes into a lot of different modules, but I was not able to completely modularize it like she did; I had my entire shape functionality stuck in the main module since I could not get it to work correctly. After looking at her code I understand what approach to use in the future for splitting my code up. Her process started with lots of functions and really taking a big chunk out of the work in the early phase, while I only did the basics and had simple functionality. I also tried to brute force my way through the code of my size function but I could have probably gotten it to work more smoothly if I had tinkered with it more. 


Looking back I want to change the way my screen was set up and make it look nicer, it is not visually pleasing, it is like a rough version of the paint program (which was my inspiration for the project). I want to be more creative and have better design choices; just because the code runs does not mean what the user is seeing is pleasing, which is definitely something I want to work on moving forward. I think I could have commented my code better since I just assumed it was okay with the variable names I was using but it is just better practice to comment it anyway.
