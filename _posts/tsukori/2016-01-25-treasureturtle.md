Reflection: I think I did everything in a really convoluted and messy way; I looked at some of the other student's work and it makes my code look so awful. I noticed a lot of people used a distance function which was really smart, I just copy and pasted it each time. I should definitely think about the assignment more and plan it on paper before jumping straight in to the coding. I think I have a good handle on useleslly long comparators and covering the cases of things. The most frustrating thing to happen was thinking about all of the different combinations of telling the user how close they were, so I just decided to give a general idea regarding both coordinates instead.
