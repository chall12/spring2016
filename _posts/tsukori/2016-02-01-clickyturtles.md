Reflection: I had a lot of fun with this assignment, especially after it was completed. I had to do a work around to make the boxes appear the way I needed them too, since I didn't want to individually make one box at a time. The grid that is made kind of hurts your eyes if you do two colors that contrast too sharply, so I would be careful with that one.
