title: 'Codename: Super Hangman Plan'
---

From my original game app I had two stretch goals that I wanted to accomplish:

- [ ] Have multiple word-size dictionary
- [ ] Mode selection: easy, normal, hard

but couldn't; so for my final project I am going to modify those two stretch goals and also improve my hangman game even more.

My main goals are to improve the appearance of the app as well as increase it's playability and replay value. I am going to do this by creating a ramping difficulty with different word lengths while saving scores so the user can challenge themself to beat it. I want it to be more visually appealing overall so I plan on having more images/drawings on the screen that change as the levels go up. 

I plan on using dicitonaries to house all of the word lists, since they are dictionaries after all. I'm playing with the idea of letting the user "save" their man after they get a certain number of words right, so they would have one of the body parts removed, giving them an extra chance of sorts.

Functionality Milestones: 
- [ ] Allow user to click on keys on the screen
- [ ] Implement score system: give points for getting words right, save highest score
- [ ] Allow user to enter their own word list
- [ ] Increasing difficulty based on score
- [ ] Improve on screen text to be more descriptive and helpful to the user

Visual Milestones: 
- [ ] Change the color of keys when they are pressed
- [ ] Make completion screen more exciting by importing outside images
- [ ] Draw more things on the screen so it's not so plain

I think this is going to be the order in which I tackle my objectives, typing it out here and thinking about it helps me organize my thoughts and how I think the project is going to come together. Once I finish I'll look back at this and see how my objectives and the order in which I complete them change. 
1. Improve help text
2. Click on keys and change the color of them
3. Score system 
4. Level system
5. Update screen based on level
6. Game over animations
7. User word list import
