So my end goal is to create a hangman game, but if that ends up failing I will come up with some kind of other typing game. So as I see it my milestones will be:

Project Standards:
- [ ] Key and click events
- [ ] Animated congratulation screen
- [ ] Keep track of game state i.e. if you collect coins, how many coins were collected
- [ ] Intuitive HUD

Base Goals:
- [ ] Draw Hangman 
- [ ] Layout letters
- [ ] 5 word "dictionary"
- [ ] Functional key presses
- [ ] Lay out spaces based on word length
- [ ] Updates hangman correctly

Optional Goals:
- [ ] Reset game ability
- [ ] Have multiple word-size dictionary
- [ ] Mode selection: easy, normal, hard
