Reflection: I found out you could use "quotation marks" instead of 'apostrophes' with the input function so that allowed me to use apostrophes in the text. I'm not all too creative so my logical turtle exercise seems a little boring. Honestly, it's 1:32 AM as I'm typing this and I'm going to fall asleep at any moment. I'll try to make the creative juices roll on the next one.
