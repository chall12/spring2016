Reflection: Using '.read' was new and made some of the previous regex functions work differently than I remembered so I had to go back to the chapter and refresh myself on what the '.findall' function is actually doing. Exercise 2 proved to be a bit of trouble but after figuring it out the other 3 came quickly since they all followed the same idea, you were just extracting a different portion of it. These exercises for me really helped in my understanding of dictionaries, I was mostly guessing and working around dictionaries the first time we did the exercises but now I feel like I understand them a lot better.
