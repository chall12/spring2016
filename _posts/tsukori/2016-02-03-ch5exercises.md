Reflection: I had some trouble with the try/except blocks before but I think I have them down pretty well now. I also learned how while loops work in python, which game me some trouble while working on the clicky turtles exercise because my while loop would loop infinitely and freeze my browser. I want to start commenting my code more effectively so it's easier for people to read and make sense of it since we pair up for assignments.
