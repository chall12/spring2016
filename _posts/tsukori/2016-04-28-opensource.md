title: "Open Source Contribution"
---

So actually finding an open source project was really hard, I started with google and that took me to github's cool open source contribution thing (https://github.com/trending/python). I looked through the most recent ones in the past month and after reading through like 15+ projects, I finally found one that I was actually sort of interested in. I started with reading the documentation and seeing what they wanted to do with the project, which confused me a lot. Programming at that level is still pretty far above my head, but I think I should be kinda close to there at this point since I'm a comp sci major as well. 

I didn't expect there to be so many projects on frameworks and libraries, things I consider high level stuff. For some reason I expected stuff like "hey look at this game I am making please help me!" or a "hello I want to do these things, but I want to make it really cool so let's all do it together!" type deal, which was pretty naive. 

The contribution I made (https://github.com/traverseda/pycraft/pull/79) was really small honestly, I wanted to do more but I also did not want to break everything that these people had worked hard on. The person who introduced the issue made a lot of edits to the code and also restyled a lot of what was originally there, so they probably made this mistake on accident. 

I might consider open source later on, but not in the forseeable future. The fear of ruining other people's work or having my work invalidated is probably the thing that holds me back the most from doing this more actively.
