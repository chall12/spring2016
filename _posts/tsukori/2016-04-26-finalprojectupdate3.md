I got really sick over the weekend and I was completely bedridden for all of Saturday and most of Sunday. I felt a bit better today but I spent a majority of today at campus health getting tests done and a check up just to make sure I'm not suffering from anything; all of that aside I got a desire to work on my program sort of late at night while I'm also extremely exhausted (programmers really are a strange breed). 

Anyway, the only progress I've made since the last update is a pretty good refactor of my code in my opinion, the modules are shorter and I feel they are better descriptions of what is actually happening in them. The stuff that should go together goes together and everything overall looks a lot cleaner. I reworked some of my old code and cut out the repetitive stuff, I'm likely going to continue to do that as I look over my program. I changed how the blanks work and now they're dynamic and will change with the word size, as well as how the game checks for when the player has guessed the word since it can't just end there anymore. 

Time is definitely a thing I am very conscious of right now and I'm not sure if I should cut my goals, or even which ones to cut at all. I know what is required at a bare minimum but I feel like this project is interesting enough/drives me enough to do more than just that. The upcoming stuff varies from slight changes to entirely new functions, so I'm really not sure how long it will take. A few bugs have cropped up cause of the refactor so I need to handle those before I go any further as well. Here's hoping to finishing on time I guess. 

Functionality Milestones: 

 - [x] Allow user to click on keys on the screen
 - [x] Give points to user for guessing words correctly
 - [ ] Allow user to enter their own word list
 - [ ] Create 3 different difficulty levels 
 - [ ] Improve on screen text to be more descriptive and helpful to the user
 - [ ] Increase difficulty based on score 
 
 Visual Milestones: 
 
 - [x] Change the color of keys when they are pressed
 - [ ] Make completion screen more exciting by importing outside images
 - [ ] Improve user interface with more drawings
 
I didn't make any actual progress on my plan which is a huge bummer but I was able to refactor my code and I am very happy about that, so let's just say it was a hidden achievement or something.
 
~~1. Think out changes, start planning them with pseudo code and concepts~~

~~2. On screen click keys that change color~~

~~3. Implement score system~~

 4. Implement level system, with ramping difficulty
 
 5. Update on screen text to include more information
 
 6. Unique screens for levels and end score
 
 7. End game animations for 4 different score ranges
 
 8. Allow user to import words
