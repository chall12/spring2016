The hardest part was looking at the raw information the printout gave you, it took a while to understand what was actually happening, and even longer to think through it each time to grab the information that you actually wanted. I kept trying to just use 'js[insertlotsofdictionarieshere]' in my if statments and that just wouldn't work for me so I threw them into variables and it all turned out peachy keen. After I finally figured out how everything was organized, picking which information to actually display took a while too. I think the hardest part about this assignment was the huge print out that came the first few times you ran it, it seemed really intimidating and it was just messy to read overall.
