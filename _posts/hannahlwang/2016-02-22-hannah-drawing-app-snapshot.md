Here is the snapshot for my drawing app, with all the elements I *wish* were working:

Here, I have created shapes for the boats (which are working exactly like I want them too), the clouds, and the birds. If you click on the water, you will make a boat with a randomly-colored sail, and ripples will appear in the water where you click. I wish that I could make the ripples appear *after* the boat is done being drawn, but when I tried that, they appeared over the boat. I wonder if there's a way to do it so that they appear behind?

More frustratingly, the functionality for draw_skything is not working like I want it to. I'm not sure if this is possible, but I would like to be able to press "b" for bird or "c" for cloud, and *then* click somewhere in the sky and have either birds or clouds drawn. I am wondering if there is some way to combine keystrokes and clicking to create some kind of compound screen action.

Just so that you can see what shapes would be drawn in the sky, here is the app with just clouds:

And here is the app with just birds:

Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the progress that I've made, and I just have a few more kinks to sort out before Thursday.
