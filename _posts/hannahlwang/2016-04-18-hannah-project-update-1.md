<h3>Milestones</h3>

- [x] Set up Cloud9 workspace
- [x] Import CSV files
- [x] Write starter code to read files

For Thursday:

- [ ] Set up separate Github repo
- [ ] Clean up data or figure out another way to deal with commas in file names
- [ ] Write code to print out summary of file
- [ ] Deal with bad user input (wrong type of file, etc)
- [ ] Determine what options will be available on main menu (and secondary menu(s), if needed)
- [ ] First option should be print out column headers and allow user to choose one

For later:

- [ ] Code the other options (once I figure them out)
- [ ] Write code to create visualizations
- [ ] Create Github repo
- [ ] Push code to Github repo

<h3>Narrative</h3>

I will be completely honest -- I have not had time to do any work on this project since Thursday. I was gone all weekend, and I have a project and presentation due tomorrow in another class. That being said, I am hopeful that I will be able to do good, consistent work on the project for the next couple of weeks. I made the realization on Tuesday that I would have to do a fair amount of data cleanup, because commas within file names are reading as delimiters, even if I use tab delimited files. This makes splitting up lists and strings incredibly difficult. Once I overcome this hurdle, I will need to determine what data analysis option I want to offer to my users. As long as I do not choose anything too ambitious, this will hopefully not be too difficult to code -- I feel pretty comfortable with lists and dictionaries now. Hopefully after this other project is done, I will be able to work on these new milestones for Thursday.
