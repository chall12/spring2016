Here is my treasure hunt! A few notes and observations:

* Tina draws a box that shows the "guessable" area of the screen
* Tina writes a key so that you know what her color changes mean:
  * Blue: Cold (more than 50 away from the treasure)
  * Purple: Warmer (between 20 and 50 away)
  * Red: Hot (less than 20 away)
* If you guess a number outside of the parameters, the program asks for a different number

Good luck!
