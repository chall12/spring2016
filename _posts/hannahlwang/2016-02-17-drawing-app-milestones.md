For my drawing app, I am going to make an ocean scene, with some attempt at perspective. The user will be able to choose what kind of object they would like to make by pressing keys ("b" for boat, "c" for cloud, "s" for seagull, etc), and draw on a particular part of the screen by clicking. They will be limited based on what area they click on (e.g. they won't be able to draw a boat in the sky). I also plan to use random colors for some elements, such as the sails. For items created on the water (boats), I also want to have ripples drawn around them, radiating out from the click.

- [x] create starter code with modules for setup and shapes
- [x] create background with water and sky
- [x] create onclick drawing action that deals with perspective
- [ ] define shapes in shapes module (boat, cloud, seagull)
- [ ] random from list of colors for boat sails
- [ ] figure out ripples (may need subtasks)

Here is my starter code:
