title: "Hannah's Dictionary Exercises"

After being sick last week, this is my *attempt* at the pair dictionary exercises. I was able to figure out the first couple, but the dictionary of dictionaries part was really difficult, and I couldn't find them covered in the reading. I attempted the total transactions section, but the totals don't seem to actually be the true totals, so I'm not quite sure how to make that work. I'm hoping that I will be able to return to these last couple questions after figuring out the whole dictionaries thing a little better.
