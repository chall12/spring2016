  Here\'s the first exercise:

  These all seemed prettyt straightforward after reading the chapter. I have some familiarity with variables and "types" from taking a C++ class before.
  The only tricky part was making sure python interpretted the variable as a float in the c to f exercise:
  ```
  c_temp = float(input("Enter Celsius Temperature: "))
  ```
  In order to force it to do that, I threw in the float() tag (class? Function? Not sure what\'s the right word here)
