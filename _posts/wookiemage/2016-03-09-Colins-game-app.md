###Here's the game:

###Here are my updated milestones:
- [x] Make a function that spawns turtles in random locations
- [x] Make a custom turtle class that has a default color and shape
- [x] Make a function that checks if two turtles are touching
- [x] Make a function that turns a turtle when it collides with a boundary or another turtle (didn't end up bouncing turtles off each other)
- [x] Make a function that governs turtle movement such that: turtle move as a function of time, and they bounce off walls
- [x] Make a function that sets up the play space with walls (visible to the player)
- [x] Make a function that allows user to reset and start over
- [x] Make a function that sets a score as a function of time and number of turtles
- [x] Make a function that displays a message when player turtle collides with other turtle (and it changes the sprite for that turtle too)
- [ ] Make a function that allows the user to move the turtle using keys - Ended up moving the turtle with the mouse
- [x] Make a function that explains goals and only runs once
- [x] Make a function that randomly changes the background color as a function of time (or a function of turn number anyway)
- [x] Make a function that generates turtles as a function of time (or a function of turn number anyway)
- [x] Make a function that changes the player turtles sprite when they collide with another turtle
- [x] Make a turtle counter
- [ ] Find and use 6 different enemy sprites. (I only ended up using one)

Stretch Goals: Turns out I didn't have time for these.
- [ ] Make a mode of this game that creates a turtle that has to be caught
- [ ] Make a function that generates turtles on click

Most of the changes I made to my milestones were design decisions, but a few were scope related. Turns out I don't have time for everything. For example, I determined that having six different sprites was a nice idea, but took more time than it was worth. If I were going to continue to flesh out this game, I would definitely find more sprites to use.

### Process
I started off by listing out my milestones. They were somewhat useful and most of them were accomplishable tasks, but some of them were much larger than the others. I ended up breaking everything down much further on whiteboards so that I could get a better idea of what each goal involved.  
Here are some photos of what that looked like:

This was very very helpful. I was able to work on different sections and functions distinctly. I dedicated different sections of whiteboard to different goals which allowed me to keep things somewhere other than my head. I could easily work on a section until I got stuck and move to another. Being able to move back and forth between different sections turned out to be helpful for problem solving as well. I was able to move on whenever I needed.
