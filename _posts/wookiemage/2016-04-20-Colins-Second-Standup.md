  ## Here's what I said I would do for today:
- [x] Build a function that opens a target file
- [x] Create a function that makes a horizontal bar chart to represent percentage breakdown between two options
- [ ] Create a function that finds the largest value in a collumn in list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that averages the values in a collumn in a list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that shows the top five most common items in a list of lists using a dictionary and counting frequency
- [ ] Create a function that prints a horizontal bar chart of the top five items -- See above milestone

As you can see from the above, I haven't made as much progress as I had hoped. Really it's all about having time to dig in and work on this project. I haven't had much time since Tuesday to work on it, so I haven't made much progress.

## Looking Ahead:

As we head into the weekend, I have a lot of code to work out. Fortunately, I'll have Friday to myself to really work on this project. So my milestone goals for Tuesday are:

- [ ] Build a menu that asks what kind of analysis to perform on the data set
- [ ] Create a function that finds the largest value in a collumn in list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that averages the values in a collumn in a list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that shows the top five most common items in a list of lists using a dictionary and counting frequency
- [ ] Create a function that prints a horizontal bar chart of the top five items -- See above milestone
- [ ] Create a function that finds the largest value and returns the row that contains the value
- [ ] Create a function that returns a key value pair that have the highest count.

### and my new stretch goal:

- [ ] Create a function that saves the data the user requests into a dictonary file.

Once I have all that accomplished, I'll have met the requirements for the assignment and the rest is gravy.
