### Reflection: 

This one wasn't so hard, but it was a good reminder to use methods that already exist like .keys and .in.

## Here's the second:

### Reflection 2:

This one was significantly harder than the first exercise. I think mostly because I was trying to .read the whole file instead of splitting it after using .readlines. Eventually I gave up on .read and had a much easier time. Yay not overcomplicated.
