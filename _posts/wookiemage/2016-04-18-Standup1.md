# Updated Plan

## For Tuesday:
- [x] Import multiple mock sales data files into my workspace
- [ ] Create a function that makes a horizontal bar chart to represent percentage breakdown between two options XXX
- [ ] Create a function that finds the largest value in a collumn in list of lists XXX
- [ ] Create a function that averages the values in a collumn in a list of lists XXX
- [ ] Create a function that shows the top five most common items in a list of lists XXX

## Scheduled later:
- [ ] Build a function that opens a target file
- [ ] Build a function that asks the user which file they want to use
- [ ] Create a function that allows the user to import their own file (not sure how possible this one will be in the c9 environment)
- [ ] Create a function that makes a horizontal bar chart to represent percentage breakdown between two options
- [ ] Create a function that can build vertical bar charts of any arbitrary width or height
- [ ] Create a function that asks the user what information they want to see
- [ ] Create a function that provides help when the user asks
- [ ] Nest it inside a while loop
- [ ] Create a function that allows the user to exit

## Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Create a function that passes IP address to the google geolocation api0
- [ ] Create a function that can retrieve a map link and pass that link to the bit.ly api
- [ ] Create a function that allows the user to launch a browser at that link
- [ ] Create a function that can build vertical bar charts of any arbitrary width or height

Nope. I didn't really get any of the Tuesday milestones accomplished for this Tuesday. This is for two main reasons. I didn't really have as much time as I was hoping to work on this project this weekend (a big paper in another course ate a lot of my time and so did my son)
Also I didn't plan it out very well. I had the functions as goals to build for today, but when I went to make them, I hadn't really thought through what my program will be doing at that point. I had to slow down and rethink what I want my program to do. I ended up resorting to whiteboards and structuring things better.

## Revised Milestones:
- [x] Create a new repository on Github
- [x] Map this repository to a new workspace in c9.io
- [x] Import multiple mock sales data files into my workspace
- [x] Build a function that offers options
- [ ] Create a function that provides help when the user asks
- [x] Build a module that houses variables
- [x] Build menu text inside the variables module
- [x] Build a module that houses menu functions
- [x] Build a menu function that asks what data a user wants to examine
- [x] Build menu functions for each level of the menu (partially complete, needs one more level of menu)
- [ ] Build a menu that asks what kind of analysis to perform on the data set
- [x] User input changes menus
- [x] User can choose to exit
- [x] Build a menu option that describes how to import data
- [ ] Build a function that opens a target file
- [ ] Create a function that makes a horizontal bar chart to represent percentage breakdown between two options
- [ ] Create a function that finds the largest value in a collumn in list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that averages the values in a collumn in a list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that shows the top five most common items in a list of lists using a dictionary and counting frequency
- [ ] Create a function that prints a horizontal bar chart of the top five items -- See above milestone
- [ ] Create a function that finds the largest value and returns the row that contains the value
- [ ] Create a function that returns a key value pair that have the highest count.

## Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Create a function that passes IP address to the google geolocation api0
- [ ] Create a function that can retrieve a map link and pass that link to the bit.ly api
- [ ] Create a function that allows the user to launch a browser at that link
- [ ] Create a function that can build vertical bar charts of any arbitrary width or height

### New Stretch Goal:
- [ ] Create a function that saves the data the user requests into a dictonary file.

## For Thursday:
- [ ] Build a function that opens a target file
- [ ] Create a function that makes a horizontal bar chart to represent percentage breakdown between two options
- [ ] Create a function that finds the largest value in a collumn in list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that averages the values in a collumn in a list of lists
- [ ] Create a function that shows the top five most common items in a list of lists using a dictionary and counting frequency
- [ ] Create a function that prints a horizontal bar chart of the top five items -- See above milestone
