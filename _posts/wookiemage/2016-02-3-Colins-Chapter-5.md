  These weren't too tricky. The hardest thing I kept running into was indentation errors. I would get it working and then try to set it inside the loop, or inside the Try/Except, but I couldn't get the danged indentation to line up. I ended up manually setting everything at no indentation and then moving it in based on how deeply it was nested. It was tedious, but it solved my issues.
