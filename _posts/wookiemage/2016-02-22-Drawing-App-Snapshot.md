## Reflection:

  The biggest problem I had with this assignment was trying to set modes that changed what happened on click. I tried two different ways to change what happened when you clicked, but neither were successful. Basically I made a function to change a variable that would serve as the index to a list of other functions that should be called when the app is clicked on. Unfortunately, due to the way the onclick function works, it only ever say the initial value not the updated value. I tried using global variables, I even tried creating a variable inside of a class so that the variable would be changed inside the object, but the onclick method still only looked at the initial value.
  I\'m not really sure I have any questions exactly. My app is pretty close to done, it certainly meets all the requirements, even if it isn\'t pretty.
