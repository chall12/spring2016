This assignment was so incredibly frustrating. It did make me have to read all the code and actually try to understand it, though I really struggled with not becoming overwhelmed every few minutes! I wanted to get it down so that only the while statement was on the main.py file but everytime I tried to add the draw screen, grid, and pieces function to the other setup file, it would make the program crash. I don't know why! At some point, everything also just got super slow. How do you work on something this big without just getting super lost in it? My program crashed so many times that I just became terrified of continuing to work on it. What can I do to make this a less painful process? If anything, this definitely taught me to appreciate neat code!
