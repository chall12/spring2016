Reflection:
(Javairia)Exercise 2 was similar to the the examples given in the book. The only difference was finding the average. I recalled that we had to do find the average in a previous exercise and did something similar to that. Exercise 3 was a little confusing when we initially started it. For me the hardest part was figuring out how to print all the rows that contained the expression.
