There were a lot of challenges with this assignment! I couldn't get the random numbers' names to be recognized outside of the function so I had to pull them out. I couldn't figure out how to then make the program loop so it could start the game over. I wanted it to be a memory game (like the flashcards kids play with) that would restart but haven't been able to figure out how to do that.
