For the most part, this assignment was pretty straight forward. I added multiple try and excepts to check for any errors. I think it should work but it seems a little complex and I'm sure there's probably a simpler way to do this. XML and JSON are still kind of confusing to me in terms of how you write code for it. This was generally just a challenging chapter for me to fully grasp in a practical sense. The assignment with the google API was helpful but I did not understand the twitter example very much.
