It took a while to figure out how to print welcome, how to multiply rate and hour because I wasn't sure how to combine the int functions in one expression. I was able to figure out the last exercise but I do think the prompt function is still a little fuzzy for me (i.e. why did I need to define temp separately? why couldn't I just use print prompt?) The other thing was I didn't know how to separate the exercises from each other.
