All of these exercises were pretty straight forward except for number 3 (the second one on here)---I misunderstood what the question was asking and went crazy trying to write code for a function that would take either a letter or string and check to see if that was in the word. Once I realized that's not what the exercise was asking, I was able to figure it out.
