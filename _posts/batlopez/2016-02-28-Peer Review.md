The app
Javairia's app has an entirely graphical user interface and uses turtle.write and the on-screen click function to communicate to the user how to "draw." It enables the user to choose between the Old Well and the Bell Tower and then renders the selected one. It then allows the user to draw with the turtle and use keys to change colors. The app does not allow the user to clear the drawing and start over. In general, I appreciated that the app had a clear intro "page" that indicated to the user what action to take to start the program. I thought the use of both keys and clicks was impressive, though it was unclear that the user would be able to "draw" after the selected image was rendered until I read through Javaira's reflection and code. 
 
The code
The code utilized custom modules well by dividing the code into main, draw, and animations. It made it significantly easier to read through her code for clarity. She also utilized functions throughout her code enabling her to separate specific drawings and actions so that they could likely be mixed and matched easily.   She incorporates three different turtles into her code and utilizes a named screen object. It runs without errors and does a good job at commenting to explain various components of her code (i.e. functions are all well commented to indicate what they do). 
 
The process
Javaira's initial and final milestones are the same except for the last one that calls for the user to reset the image; she made tangible milestones for herself that she was able to achieve. From her reflection, it is clear that she made progress on figuring out how to select parts of her screen that corresponded with specific actions. I am curious to know how she wanted the "coloring" part to work--she indicates that it is not exactly what she wanted. Perhaps, milestones can be written more specifically to indicate the actual specifics of the app, rather than broader milestones. I wrote broad ones too to give myself wiggle room but I wonder if it can be helpful during the process. 
 
Self-reflection	
Javaira used a number of techniques that I thought strengthened her code. She separated her drawing code from her animation code which made hers significantly easier to read through. If I had separated these, I may have had an easier time trying to edit/fix my program without it freezing. I also thought she incorporated a clear starting page which I could have done better. I failed to indicate how the user could work with the screen to "draw."
 
Two things that may have improved her app would have been to indicate to the user that they were able to color the drawing using "c" on the keyboard and clicking around the turtle and to add a reset button on her screen. Though I was able to add a reset button, I didnâ€™t know how to prompt it to actually loop back to the start of the program rather than just clear it off.
