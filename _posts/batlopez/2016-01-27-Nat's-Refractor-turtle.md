This assignment was actually really rewarding because I was able to code so much faster than ever before. I guess I'm starting to get more comfortable with our assignments! I couldn't figure out how to use return outside of the context of numbers. Other things I found challenging were just trying  to figure out where I was on the screen (i.e if I wanted Tina to the other end of the screen, how do I do that without just guessing? It took me a bit to get the arguments and how they worked but that wasn't too hard to figure out once I referred back to the reading. My first rendition, I had the message get printed in the chatbox but remembered I could have tina.write on the screen. I would like to make the text bigger.

Note: I never submitted a logical turtle, so I don't have an original to include.
