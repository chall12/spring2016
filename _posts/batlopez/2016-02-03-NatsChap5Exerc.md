I'm embarassed to say I really struggled with this first exercise because I didn't realize break had to go at the end of the if statement. I don't understand why I can't put the if statement with the break after the statement evaluating whether x is an integer. Is that true all the time or am I missing something? Also, I kept trying to use x=int(x) before this current statement and wasn't sure why that doesn't work. In general, once I figured out that break should go at the end, that totally made logical sense. I don't really get why the other two things I mentioned don't work.
