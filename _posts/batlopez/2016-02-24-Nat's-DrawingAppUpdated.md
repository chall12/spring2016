I struggled with this assignment as a whole. Initially, I began with the idea of having three different faces as options but realized that I did not know how to write code so that it would select a whole circle and then layer onto that. I decided to pare down and focus on just one face and having a series of options for eyes, nose, and mouth.
One thing in general that was really hard was that at some point, if I tried to change anything, I would start getting huge errors in my code and it was really frustrating to figure out what was wrong. For example, when I tried to name different turtles, it totally messed up the placement of all my facial attributes and every time I tried switching them around, I'd just end up messing it all up, so at some point, I just reverted back to my old code. (Except, I’m pretty sure something wonky is happening to it now, which is very frustrating!)
I also initially wanted to use dragging functions but realized I didn't know how to drag an entire part of a drawing rather than use it as a drawing pencil.The other thing that I couldn't figure out was how to reset---I believe that has to do with the naming of the turtles. So I can get it to cleaar the page, but I can't figure out how to set it up again. I tried to use loops, but it would also make my entire program crash. This was honestly a really challenging assignment. I found myself really struggling (though I’ve also been sick this week). I’d like to keep working on this assignment and hopefully improve upon some of the bugs.
