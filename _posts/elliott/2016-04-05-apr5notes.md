# Dictionaries Part Deux

Things to remember:

- You're looping through each row.  If a state exists, do one set of things.  If not, do another set of things.  That's the pattern for both 1 and 3.
- `('\t').join(["some", "LIST", "of", "things"])` is an idiom!  Live it, love it, use it.  You can also join around spaces, commas, whatever you need.
- Got a header in your list of lists? **Slice it off**
- Got bad data?  Manually clean it.  Or automatically clean it.  Or try/except.
