# Remote Class

For this class you're reading the notes ahead of time and working for at least 40 minutes with a partner via video.


This time there is no video.  Just head over to the class chat at our normally scheduled class time and find your partner, who will be the **same person** as last time. [Here's the exercise description]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/clinic.html)
