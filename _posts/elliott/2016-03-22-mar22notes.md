# Spring Break Hacks

# Cloud 9

You should be set up on Cloud 9's free plan.  We'll use that starting Thursday.

# Python 3

We'll be using Python 3 in Cloud9 and Trinket from here out.  Remember your `print()` functions.  

`sep=" "` lets you specify what the seperator between arguments is.  It defaults to a space.

`end='\n'` lets you specify what to do at the end of the print functin.  It defaults to a newline.

You can make anonymous Python 3 trinkets on Trinket for free.  If you want the convenience of saving your 
Python 3 trinkets to your account, you can use code `inls560` to get our premium plan at a huge discount of 
two bucks a month.

When we start running Python on Cloud 9, remember to type `python3` instead of `python`.

# Files

There are a few core actions you should be able to perform on files:

* Open them (Dr. Chuck)
* Search/extract information from them (Dr. Chuck)
* Build a data structure from them (not really Dr. Chuck)
* Explore your data (not really Dr. Chuck)
* Print a table from your data (not Dr. Chuck)

We'll do all of these today.

Something Dr. Chuck didn't cover: the `with` statement.  This is the Pythonic way to open a file:

```python
with open("sales.csv") as file:
  sales_raw = file.read()
  # Or, if you need lines:
  sales_lines = file.readlines()
```

Otherwise you'll have to open and close the file handler and it's a pain.

# Lists of Lists

Making a list full of lists gives you some interesting powers.  First, you can think of each item in 
the main list as a row and each item in the interior lists as a cell/column.  As long as you keep the lengths 
constant you've got what amounts to a spreadsheet, but in Python!

Here's how you can visualize a list of lists:

```
[ [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...]
  [... , ... , ...] ]
```

This one has five rows and three columns.

To work with lists of lists you'll nee lots of **slicing** and **indexing**.  Remember the `list[x:y:z]` syntax.

Let's get to work!  I recommend you read over questions 1-3 briefly and then go straight to exercise 4.
