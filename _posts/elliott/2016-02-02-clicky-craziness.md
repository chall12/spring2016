# Q & A

* What the heck happened with our site?  A [jekyll upgrade](https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0)
* Where are the exercises if this ever happens again? [_posts/exercises](https://github.com/silshack/spring2016/tree/gh-pages/_posts/exercises) 
(they're posts just like you make but with some extra custom stuff)


# Pair Up & then Circle Up!

We're going to quickly [pair]({{ site.baseurl }}/pairup.html), discuss and merge your posts, then you'll introduce your partner's work
to the class.  Your partner can then discuss their program for us.

# Thursday

Chapter 5 reading & exercises.  We'll *finally* go over loops!  Woot.
