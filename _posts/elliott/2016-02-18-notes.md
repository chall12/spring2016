# Remote Class

For this class you're reading the notes ahead of time and working for at least 30 minutes with a partner via video.  Treat this as you would any collaboration with a colleage in class - be on time, be helpful, and do your best to use your tools like video chat and github effectively.  This situation mimics an increasingly common professional scenario where your teammates don't live in your city.  At Trinket, for instance, we're currently working extensively with German, Dutch, and Californian collaborators.

# Video

Here's a video I recorded going over some tips for working with scope in custom modules with Turtle:

# In-class remote exercise

This is the first time we've done this so please work together to make it go as smoothly as possible!  At our scheduled class time, find your partner in our class chat room and complete the [in-class exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/milestones-inclass.html).
