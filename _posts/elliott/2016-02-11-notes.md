# Q & A

* Question 8.4
* Question 8.5
* Question 8.6

# Another look ahead

Check out our [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule.html)

I'll be out for three class periods and you have a big project due while I'm away. 
(What dummy made up this schedule?)

Keep calm- you can do this!  

We've been doing a lot of collaborative work.  This period mimics remote work.
You'll have to use remote collaboration tools to interact with me and with your peers.
**While I'm gone remote class means read the notes**.  You will still have 'in-class'
assignments and we'll 'pair up' remotely.

# Pair Programming Review

* Communication is key!  Think out loud.  Work your partner into your thought process.
* Pair programming may feel slower.  That's natural.  Slow down and buy in to get the benefits.
* The Navigator can't get anywhere without the driver.  
* The Driver doesn't know where to go without the navigator.
* Tell your partner what you need from them.  Ask them for it!
