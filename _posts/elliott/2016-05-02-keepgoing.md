Colin had a great request for a list of resources that students can use to keep going deeper with Python.  Here's the beginning of a list, and I hope students will add it it (via pull request, of course :)

# Resource Websites

There are various great online resources that you can use as you work on projects.

* TBD

# Online Classes

There are a growing number of great online classes you can take for fun.

* Python for Everyone by Charles Severance on Coursera
* CS for All by Harvey Mudd College on EdX
* Python for Numerical Analysis by Lorena Barba on OpenEdX

# UNC Classes

UNC offers plenty of classes that will help you go deeper with data analysis and Python

* INLS 613 Text Mining with Jaime Arguello - a chance to use a programming language of your choice to analyze text
* INLS 760 Web Databases with Rob Capra - HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and SQL for making database-backed Web apps
* COMP 523 Software Engineering Lab by Diane Pozefsky - Work on a team to build software
* COMP 562 Intro to Machine Learning by Valdmir Jojic - Machine learning with (I think) Matlab

# Non-UNC Classes & Hack Schools

Lots of places offer in-person (or virtual) hack classes to learn professional skills

* Bloc.io
* Dev Bootcamp
* Hackbrite Academy
* CodeSchool
