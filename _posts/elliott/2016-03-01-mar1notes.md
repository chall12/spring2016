# Q&A

- should you ever merge your own pull request?
- Major project labels: thanks for the help, but let me label them so I can keep track

Some stuff having to do with Jekyll:

- Markdown lists and such.  In general, use lots of empty lines to make sure our markdown
parser gets things right (I make this mistake too).
- Filename collisions.  Give your file a unique title (after the date part)

# Looking ahead: Games!

Your second project is due before spring break: make a Game app using Turtle.
Thursday you'll have miletones, we'll do an in-class peer clinic, but there will
be no snapshot or peer review this time.  Everything should be pretty familiar!

Think of this as more of a 'game sketch' like I describe in the video than a full
featured game.  If you choose to make a game for your final you can do all the bells
and whistles.

# Code talks

Write up:

- App
 - Creativity
 - Usability
- Code
 - Organization
 - Comments
- Process
 - Milestones
 - Design
 - Improvement


Let's discuss your code.  I've selected eight programs for their authors and reviewers to introduce and us to discuss briefly.

# Two solid apps

Hannah and Will had very well executed apps.  Hannah's code was clean and well organized.

Hannah's boat scene very well-executed:

Will's extremely usable drawing app:

# Modes of Drawing

Payal and Yiyang's apps are great examples of using buttons to change the behavior of a program.

Payal's fun (and fast) Ice Cream app:

Yiyang's face maker has tons of replay value:

# Modes of the App

Kit and Becca used 'modes' to mean different behavior for the program overall!

Kit's great two-mode program:

Becca's great three-mode program:

# Looking Ahead: Images

Jason and Natalie learned how to use custom images in their apps, making them more engaging.

Jason's atmospheric background image (also kudos for splitting pre-midnight and post midnight versions):

Natalie's great modern art app (using custom images for Turtles):
