# Logistics

Most exercises going forward will be due the night before class to allow for me to 
review them.

You'll also review and merge each others' work in class.

Review, fix, and close issues assigned to you. We'll have some catch-up time where
we can review any outstanding issues.

Gittr chat.

# Review & Merge Posts

Volunteer: Merging with Tommy Tester.

* Reviewing PRs - comment on them directly
* Merging - Your responsibility to make sure your partner's post works! Check that it shows up on our site
* Assigning issues - already merged work with problems


~10 minutes reviewing & merging posts with a partner.

# Discussion: Logic and the Flow of Control

Boolean values are very simple but very powerful.  There are tons of useful ways to 
construct **expressions** that evaluate to `True` or `False` in Python, and we use these
to change the behavior of our program. 

Basic `if` statements act as 'gates' to control whether blocks of code get executed.
`elif` and `else` statements enhance this control.
