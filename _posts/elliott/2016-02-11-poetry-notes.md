# Q & A

* Question 8.4
* Question 8.5
* Question 8.6
* Student todos - I'll open them when I see them but you should be looking over your assignments, confirming that they display correctly, and submitting any fixes needed
* I'll assign todos when they're one person but for two people I'll have to settle for atmentioning you.
* Feel free to ask questions about todos- they're not to make you feel bad, they're to help you learn!
* Deleting merged branches
* Three of you are **Watching** our repo.  Unwatch if you're getting spammed.  **Make sure you're getting emails for atmentions**

# Another look ahead

Check out our [schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule.html)

I'll be out for three class periods and you have a big project due while I'm away. 
(What dummy made up this schedule?)

Keep calm- you can do this!  

We've been doing a lot of collaborative work.  This upcoming period mimics remote work.
You will use **remote collaboration tools** to interact with me and with your peers.
**While I'm gone remote class means read the notes**.  You will still have 'in-class'
assignments and we'll 'pair up' remotely.

# Pair Programming Review

*"Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so. - See more [here](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/pairing.html)"*

* Communication is key!  Think out loud.  Work your partner into your thought process.
* Pair programming may feel slower.  That's natural.  Slow down and buy in to get the benefits.
* The Navigator can't get anywhere without the driver.  
* The Driver doesn't know where to go without the navigator.
* Tell your partner what you need from them.  Ask them for it!
