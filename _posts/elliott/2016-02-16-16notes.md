# Q & A

* Drafts vs Saving in Trinket
* Nice problem solving attitudes!  I saw so many feels in your posts:  
  * confidence
  * infuriating
  * furtrating
  * centered
  * wrestled
  * enjoyed
  * helpful
  * persistence
  * beautiful
  * nervous
  * fun
  * "not nearly as horrible as I feared it would be"
* I'm not lying when I say that knowing how you're feeling is a core competency of programming.
* Tetris: Moving turtles around & scope.  More in my video for next class
* Reflections: Thank you!  Great to see the thought you put into these.
* Seeing old code with new eyes
* Supportive community of people learning to code: http://www.codenewbie.org/
* Pair programming feedback (disclaimer: I like 3 hour classes much better)

# Tracer and Update

`.tracer(x)` makes the animation update only every x frames, which makes it go faster.  If you use `.tracer(0)`, no frames will update.  What?

Never fear: `.update()` will force the animation to be redrawn.  Setting tracer to 0 then updating can be a way to instantly set up your screen.

`.tracer(1000)` is used in the tetris program because so many animations are happening they need to skip 999 of them to make it a playable game.
Kudos to those of you who figured this out and started messing with them.  Use these tools in your drawing app!
