# Files

Here's my solution for the exercies:

<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python3/03dfabddb0" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Notice: no `i = 0`, no `while` loops, and no `range()` needed.  Lots of `for` loops and, to get fancy, `.join()`ing around a `"\t"`.

In short, slice out the rows you want, `for` loop over them, and *do something* with each row.

# Jekyll & git

Hard homework?  This was like a blog post, walk-thru, or stack overflow answer.  Even starting with
*exactly* the same development environment, small deviations from or errors in the instructions can 
throw you off.

I made a [how-to]({{ site.baseurl }}/how-to/gitcheatsheet.html).

You'll have a second chance to improve your posts before being evaluated on their formatting.

# Quiz

Yup.

# Regexes

Just like last time, I recommend glancing over the first ones and working on the last one together.
