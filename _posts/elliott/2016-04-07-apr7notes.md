Notes:

- `From:` vs `From `
- `.read()` lets you extract everything with one regex.  With `.readlines()` you can loop over lines with a simpler regex
- Props: Hannah had a great idea: extract only the `From ` lines, then do all the exercises on just those.
- Props: Javairia sovlved all the exercises in one big loop, then printed the results.
- Props: Lingjie (and maybe one or two others?) extracted the data all at once with a regex
