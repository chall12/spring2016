# Remote Class

For this class you're reading the notes and watchig the videos ahead of time, then working for at least 40 minutes with a partner via video during our normally scheduled class time.  Treat this as you would any collaboration with a colleague in class - be on time, be helpful, and do your best to use your tools like video chat and github effectively.  This situation mimics an increasingly common professional scenario where your teammates don't live in your city.  At Trinket, for instance, we're currently working extensively with German, Dutch, and Californian collaborators and have a biweekly video call with a partner in the UK.

# Video on Scope

In these videos you can see men **make and recover from mistakes live**.  I tell myself that it's OK to
make mistakes- I'll just turn them into teaching moments for my students.  But for real we all encounter
unexpected errors.  I that's one of the things bothering you, check out how I do it in these videos and
see if my methods help.  THere are also several points when I write less code then I know I want and run
it to make sure there are no bugs and everything behaves as expected.

Here's the video I recorded going over some tips for working with scope in custom modules with Turtle:

# Video on the Screen object

Here's the video I recorded going over turtle's Screen more in depth.  It should complement the O'Reilly video well.

# In-class remote exercise

This is the first time we've done this so please work together to make it go as smoothly as possible!  At our scheduled class time, find your partner in our class chat room and complete the [in-class exercise]({{ site.baseurl }}/exercise/milestones-inclass.html).
