- Any Qs?

# Check-in

How are your **Meetups** coming?

5 minute Meetups Scatergories.  Make a list of 3-5 local (less than one hour drive from UNC) programming meetups, with links 
to a website and their next meeting. (Must have an upcoming meeting)

Scoring: One point for each qualified meetup that's totally unique.

Who wins: Besides us all, since we now have a dedicated list of great meetups? The person(s)
with the highest score.

How are your **Open Source** contributions coming?

Consider playing a similar game with some friends.
