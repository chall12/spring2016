Exercise 1 was straightforward. I liked it and it liked me.

Figuring out Exercise 2 would not have been so difficult had I not had trouble creating a text file. Keeping the text file name referenced in the instructions caused Trinket to have a fit. It took quite some time to negotiate a truce and patch things up by naming the new text file as dully as I could. I also forgot, once again, how the positions of the entries in a list are calculated. Had I remembered that, I'd have cracked the puzzle more quickly. As it was, though, I had fun poking and prodding at the code and my text file in an attempt to break things. It's funny to have to break something before you can fix it.
