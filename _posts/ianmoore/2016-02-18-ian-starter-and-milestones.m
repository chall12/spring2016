[x] Build starter code
[] Working interface - Buttons respond to clicks, mode buttons clear when one mode is selected.
[] Mode 1 - First mode will draw
[] Mode 2 - Second mode will draw
[] Mode 3 - Third mode will draw
[] Clear and reset - Clear button functions correctly, program resets to initial state, ready for user to reinitiate
[] Debugging - Check to make sure that everything <i>actually works</i>.

Ultimately, I'd like users to be able to draw in three different ways, with the ability to quit and pick a new mode at any time.

My starter code is below:
