title: "Ian's Logical Turtle"

This is my logical turtle:

The logical turtle was fairly straightforward, with one notable exception. I tried to make a string conditional, which I apparently can't do? I'm not 100% on that. By using option 1 and option 2, I was able to do something similar to my original intent, but I wish the first option had worked.
