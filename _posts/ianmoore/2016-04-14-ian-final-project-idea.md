I intend to make a refined version of my text adventure. My text adventure was workable, but hugely unwieldy. What I'd like to be able to do is create a new text adventure that checks the state created at the end of each "level" and implements the next level based on that. In the previous version, my code had to be entered in reverse chronological order because each click function depended on the function before it. This led to a set of functions that I found difficult to read. It was even more difficult to explain to others.

My hope is that this new version will, in addition to implementing a new story, create a readable set of code. With any luck, each function will follow on logically from the function before it. 

#####These are my milestones:
- [ ] Write brief story outline
- [ ] Diagram story flow on paper
- [ ] Build initial version of program with flow from "level one" to "level two"
- [ ] Build beta version of program with all levels implemented
- [ ] Implement win screen
- [ ] Test and fix bugs
