This is my treasure hunt:

The most difficult part of this was making sure that every possible combination of entries would produce some sort of result for the player. This has definitely been the most complicated program for me thus far, in no small part because guaranteeing that all my equations were correct. That single task occupied more time than any other component of the work. I am not a math person, and parsing the logic of the combinations of ```>`` and ```<``` that I produced was relatively difficult for me. 
It is also worth noting that my code is insane. It does not need to be as complicated as it is. Defining additional variables and creating some sort of equation for distance would have made this vastly simpler and easier to parse. It was all fun, though! My problems were very solvable, ultimately, which was great!
