This is my snapshot:

To be honest, I think I'm ready to call this done. This is version two, because I decided it would be better/simpler to rewrite and simplify the code rather than just refactor the original. I have met all of the milestones I set for myself, and everything works. As far as I can tell, at least. I have tried to break it in every way possible, and my only real frustration (shapes draw into spaces I have defined as part of the UI) cannot, as far as I can tell, be solved within turtle. I suspect I would need to start windowing parts of the program, something I don't know that turtle is capable of.
