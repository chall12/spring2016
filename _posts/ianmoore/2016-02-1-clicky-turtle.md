This is my clicky turtle:

This assignment wound up being the most difficult task I've had to complete for this class. This was not, perhaps surprisingly, a result of the ```clicky``` function itself, but because I tried to incorporate a ```while``` loop. Every time I tried to run the program with the loop included, my browser crashed or demanded that the script be stopped. I tried it in both Chrome and Firefox, but found myself unable to solve the issue. Ultimately, I was forced to find a different way to complete the task. My program does not have a win condition, nor does it incorporate the ```distance``` function, which I had also hoped to use. I think this is an excellent example of why I shouldn't beat my head against the wall trying to finish something. Trying to get the first version to work took most of a day. Completing the second took less than an hour.
