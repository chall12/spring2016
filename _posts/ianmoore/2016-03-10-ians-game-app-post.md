This is my game:

I think I've finally found a strategy for success in our bigger projects. In essence, I think I've recreated the the creation of an alpha version of program. I make a version of the program that is feature-complete but crashes all over the place, then start over in a new trinket with a more efficient/functional version. I did this with the drawing app and again with the game. It makes the process much more comfortable. I have the opportunity to implement the program piece by piece and debug as I rebuild. It's much more straightforward than trying to fix messy code in an initial version. 

During the process of making the game, I had two primary issues. The first was trying to get my text to wrap correctly. Elliot helped me with that by providing pseudocode, which I managed to implement successfully. I don't know that I did exactly what Elliot was thinking, but his code allowed me to write the text for my text adventure without having to watch it wander off the edge of the screen. I did spend about two days working on that problem, but I think I've resolved it relatively successfully. 

The second significant issue was dealing with the flow of the the application. I had to diagram on paper the flow of the story and the click functions and options that would go along with them. This was an absolute revelation. Instead of muddling through and having to remember where I was and having to juggle what to do next without letting something get past me, I was able to proceed from task to task by following my flowchart. Problem solving! It's the best!

The following are my game milestones - 

- [x] The screen will transition based from scene to scene based on user key input. It doesn't do key input, but it does respond to clicks

- [x] The game will have a coherent story. There is a story. Whether it is coherent or not is up to you.

- [x] The game will allow the user to meet a win condition.

- [x] The win condition will have an animated win screen.

Optional goals include - 

- [x] The animated win screen will include a a castle drawn by a turtle. 

- [ ] A turtle drawing will accompany portions of the story. This goal was not met.
