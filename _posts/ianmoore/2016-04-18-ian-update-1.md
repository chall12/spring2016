This weekend, I wrote the story for my game and diagrammed it on paper. On Monday, I got bored making the pseudocode and dove in to the actual programming. So far, much of it has gone well, but I need to be able to change the game state as the result of a click by the user. This is causing problems for me. It's difficult to tell what's gone wrong in a ```while``` loop when the loop brings the whole browser down with it. Other than that, things seem to be going fairly well. It's just a question of re-implementing certain code from the old game without making more headaches for myself. If I can get the flow from the first scene to the second working, everything else should be pretty straightforward.
