This presented a bit of a challenge in that I did not have an equation for the ```return``` aspect of the assignment. Integrating that without making it seem forced was difficult. I'm very proud of figuring out the ```for`` loop. I played around with it earlier, but I couldn't get it to work. I tried to make things too complicated again. That is absolutely the lesson of the day for me. Simplicity makes things better, especially when it comes to code.
