Using the functions made me think that I had really been overcomplicating things in the past. Yes, the functions make things simpler in and of themselves, but I redid some of my equations in the pay program. Simplifying the equations makes them easier to parse, which is absolutely, definitely something to keep in mind in the future. I need to comment well and keep things simple.
