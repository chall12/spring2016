### These are my milestones:
- [x] Build starter code
- [x] Working interface - Buttons respond to clicks, mode buttons clear when one mode is selected.
- [x] Mode 1 - First mode will draw
- [x] Mode 2 - Second mode will draw
- [x] Mode 3 - Third mode will draw
- [x] Clear and reset - Clear button functions correctly, program resets to initial state, ready for user to reinitiate
- [x] Debugging - Check to make sure that everything <i>actually works</i>.

Ultimately, I'd like users to be able to draw in three different ways, with the ability to quit and pick a new mode at any time.

My starter code is below:
