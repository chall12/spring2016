I think I expected to have more trouble with the third exercise, but I found it fairly straightforward. My issue was really with the second exercise. I was confused at first by ```try``` and ```except```. I tried to treat them more like ```if``` and ```else```, which made things very complicated for me at first. I think I got too invested in trying to make them work the way I wanted them to, rather than trying to figure out how they worked. Having the Logical Turtle to practice on was nice, because I did figure everything out in that context.
