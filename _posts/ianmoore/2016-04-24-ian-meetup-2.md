title: "Ian's Second Meetup"

On Monday, April 18, I went to TriPython's Durham project night. After the Open Source Open Mic, I think this meetup was a bit of a letdown. It was very, very quiet, and everybody kept to themselves. I think I was reminded very clearly that I work best when there's a bit of noise in the background. Not having any made it a bit difficult to concentrate.

I did get some work done, though. I started on the structure of my game, which I ultimately overhauled completely the next day after talking to Elliot. I noticed on the meetup page that the Chapel Hill project night gets a bigger turnout. In the future, I'd like to try going there and finding out whether it has a livelier atmosphere.
