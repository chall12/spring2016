This is the assignment where my inability to update and iterate the variable came back to bite me. Because I was unable to do it last week, I used a list instead. Here, I had to use both. I got stuck trying to split the list, which got me precisely nowhere. Going back and working on the variable provided an actual solution. Moral of the day: if you have to use a workaround, go back and make sure you learn as much as you can about the thing you had to work around. You might have to use it later.
