Reflection:
We learned that to declare dictionary within a dictionary, you have to enter a specific key for the larger dictionary and then declare it with empty curly braces {}. We got stuck for a while on making a list of the key and value to get the â€˜\t'.join to work. While Jay was able to figure out how to create the dictionary of dictionaries more quickly than me, he mentioned that his understanding of the code was improved by explaining it to me. I would like to get a better understanding of the big picture- how programmers choose when to use lists, dictionaries, and classes when manipulating data.
