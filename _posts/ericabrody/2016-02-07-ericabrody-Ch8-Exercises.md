Reflection:
First, strings can do a lot - so Chapter 8 had a lot of new information and built-in functions to take in. 
For Exercise 1, I didn't set up the loop well at first, I started with while inp !='done' which didn't work well.  Initially, I forgot to append each entered item to a list. It really helped when i figured out that the average program in the chapter had some clues; however, i am not sure if my program returns, "None".
For Exercise 2, it took me a while to figure this out and I guess that the potentially problematic line of code is printing the 3rd item in the list, but I am not sure if this is correct. I am probably overthinking some of this. Similarly, Exercise 3 is easier than i thought it would be so perhaps I missed something there. not sure.
