Here is my Treasure Hunt program:

Reflection:
Although I wanted to start programming right away, I realized that I had to take a few minutes away from Trinket, and think about the 
specific steps that I needed to do to get to the goal. In particular, it really helped to draw out an example of what I needed to do. 
For example, I drew a grid and a point for the treasure and an input point to identify the coordinates of the third point of a 
right triangle to get the numbers I needed to use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the distance between the two points.
I also spent a fair bit of time thinking about where to put statements with respect to loops. Initially, I put a copy of the same statement
into three consecutive if/elif/elif statements and then realized that I could put that statement outside of the three loops and 
the program would work the same way with fewer lines of code. 
I chose to create turtle stamps for each guess and to print the distance betwen the points for each guess to help users find the treasure
faster. I am not sure how helpful the stamps are and they can get kind of garbled on the screen when guesses are close to each other,
but I like the visual.
