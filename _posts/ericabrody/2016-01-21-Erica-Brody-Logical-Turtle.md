Title: "Erica's Logical Turtle Program"

Here is my logical turtle program:

Refection

I used parts of my second turtle draw program and the convert score to grade program to write this program. This repetition helped
me to get better at writing syntactically correct statements and recognizing when an error message indicated an indent problem for 
a conditional (even if the error didn't say indent). Initially, I built the whole program with try/except and if/else and there were bugs.
To figure out where the bugs were, I created a duplicate program and eliminated the try/except and conditional. Once I got the main loop
code for drawing the squares to work, adding in the if/else and then the try/except worked well. While debugging, I also tested out the 
strategy of getting away from the code for a bit (with a Facebook break) and it worked very well. When I came back to the program,
the fixes some errors became obvious.
