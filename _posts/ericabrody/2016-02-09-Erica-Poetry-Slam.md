Here is my program that prints poetry lines on the screen:

Reflection:
I was able to use a bunch of code that I wrote for earlier programs to write this one. It turns out that practicing writing with Tina for Ch. 6 Ex 3 & 4 when I didn't need the turtle to do the writing was helpful. I am storing each line of the poem entered into a list, not sure i will need this but it seemed like a good idea.
