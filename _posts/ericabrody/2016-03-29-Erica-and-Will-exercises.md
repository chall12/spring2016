Reflection:
For Exercise 3, our first attempt [left in the code, but commented out] kept generating multiople copies of the last line in the file and the biggest challenge was realizing that this indicated that the items in the selected column were in a list, but they were not and we had to intentionally put them in a list using <cells = row[:]>. Visualizing the columns and rows was challenging, intuitively, we were thinking the opposite of each other so we named our variables differently. The example in the book helped a lot with Exercise 2. Testing each step as we went worked out well to help with debugging.
