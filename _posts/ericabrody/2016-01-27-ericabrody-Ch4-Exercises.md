Reflections:
For these programs, I thought about the user experience - 
I wanted to let users re-enter their input if their initial input was invalid, rather than just giving them an error message
and ending the program.  
For the calculation of the pay - my original program did not provide error messages about the variable being a string until AFTER the user input BOTH hours and rate,
so I changed the program to give the user an error message after entering invalid input for hours until a valid hours number was provided and then doing the same thing
for rate.
