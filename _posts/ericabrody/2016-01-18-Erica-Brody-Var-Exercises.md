Reflections: It took a long time to figure out how to use the int function - when I copied the program from the chapter int(variable name),
my variable seemed to remain a string because I got errors when I tried to use math to calculate the pay variable. I am not sure how
I thought to try redefining the hours and rate variables, i.e., hours=int(hours), rate=int(rate) - so grateful this worked.
