Here are my milestones:
- [ ] create setup screen - set screen size and then draw black square around edges of the screen so users can see them
- [ ] create setup screen - draw set of 4 square shaped buttons at upper left of screen with black edges and different color fill
- [ ] when user clicks on the button, the background color of the screen will change to that color
- [ ] When user presses the 'z' key, the turtle object shape will cycle through 3 options (turtle, arrow, circle)
- [ ] to display shape mode to user, use unique (non-drawer) turtle object to make a stamp in the lower right hand corner of screen
- [ ] to display shape mode to user, when the turtle object changes shape, clear previous stamp and make a new stamp with the new shape, perhaps using "clearstamp"
- [ ] When user presses the 's' key, the turtle size will cycle through 3 or 4 different sizes to draw thinner or thicker lines
- [ ] to display turtle size, use unique (non-drawer, non-shape indicator) turtle object to write small or medium or large at bottom left hand corner of screen
- [ ] When user presses the 'c' key, the turtle will draw a small circle size = 20 pixels in diameter
- [ ] when user presses the 't' key, the turtle will draw a triangle
- [ ] when user presses the arrow keys, the turtle will go forward and backward & turn left and right
- [ ] when user clicks on the screen, the turtle will draw a line to the x,y coordinates of the part of the screen clicked
- [ ] when user clicks spacebar, the screen will clear the screen and allow the user to start over
- [ ] when user clicks on turtle object, the turtle object will change to a different color, cycling through 4 preselected colors 

Questions: 
- How to think about programming for user to click on button I drew to allow for change in screen background color? Do I need to track the x,y positions of the button corners?
- Will I need to use a new turtle for clicks on the buttons that first goes to the turtle in penup / hideturtle mode so the user doesn't keep drawing lines to the buttons?

Reminders to myself:
- Use the tracer feature to avoid the creation of unwanted artifacts on the screen
- Cycling through colors and shapes will be done with for loops, i.e., definite loops

Sorry, no time to create starter code
