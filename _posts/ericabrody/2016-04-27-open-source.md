During the second week of class, I noticed some frustrating typos in our textbook. Specifically, there were some garbage characters mixed into the explanation about operators in Python, making it hard to figure out the syntax of actual operators. After alerting Elliott about these typos, he offered to let me create a pull request on the textbook repo to suggest corrected text. Github was still very new to me; however, I was able to submit the pull request and it was merged, probably by Elliott. It was exciting to contribute so directly to someone else’s project. It seemed exciting to Elliott as well, since he tweeted about it. 

During the last month, I reviewed Sahana Eden and Open Hatch, and was unable to find an active project that had a task that made sense to me. Sahana Eden had a section for testing tasks that looked promising, but I couldn’t find anything current there. Upon reflection, I wish I had asked about this at the Python meetup I went to. 

Here is a link to the contribution https://github.com/csev/pythonlearn/pull/89
