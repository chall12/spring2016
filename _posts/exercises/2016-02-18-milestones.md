Submit a well-formatted pull request with a post containing your project milestones and, if you have time, some starter code.


# Milestones

Developing and tracking Milestones is an important project management technique.
A good milestone is clear, achieveable, and is aligned to important program functionality
(like 'program accepts clicks from user') or user capabilities (like 'user can click
screen to draw a shape').  Together, your milestones should equal a succefully completed
project.

To go along with your starter code, include your project milestones for your drawing app.
The first few items may be crossed off by your starter code, and the remaining items on your
milestone list form a handy to-do list for breaking down the remaining work on your project.

When you turn in your project you'll turn in a revised list of milestones and the ones you
check off should have satisfied the requirements of the assignment.  It's OK to revise or not
got to some of your milestones- revising **scope** is a big part of project managment.  Just
make sure that you hit the project requriements before spending time on getting fancy.

# Use Check boxes

Use markdown's `- [ ]` and `- [x]` to display un-checked and checked boxes, respectively.
This gives a good visual sense of how far you are.  For example:

- [x] Milestone one
- [ ] Milestone two
- [ ] Milestone three


# Starter Code

Do the following before class if you can.  If not, at least come with a basic Trinket that you will 
be using for your project.

For many of your past projects I've given you starter code.  This code implemented
helpful functions or contained the basics of the user interface.  Your task for this 
assignment is to make your own starter code for your drawing app.

Make sure to **duplicate** your starter code on trinket and embed a version you
will not be editing.  Updates on Trinket will automatically show up in your embeds
otherwise.

While my O'Reilly videos should contain lots of good ideas for you, your starter code
should be **your own work**.  Do not copy and paste any code for this exercise.
