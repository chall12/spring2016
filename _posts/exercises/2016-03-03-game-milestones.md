Submit a well-formatted pull request with a post containing your starter code
and your project milestones.

# Milestones

Developing and tracking Milestones is an important project management technique.
A good milestone is clear, achieveable, and is aligned to important program functionality
(like 'program accepts clicks from user') or user capabilities (like 'user can click
screen to draw a shape').  Together, your milestones should equal a succefully completed
project.

When you turn in your project you'll turn in a revised list of milestones and the ones you
check off should have satisfied the requirements of the assignment.  It's OK to revise or not
got to some of your milestones- revising **scope** is a big part of project managment.  Just
make sure that you hit the project requriements before spending time on getting fancy.

# Use Check boxes

Use markdown's `- [ ]` and `- [x]` to display un-checked and checked boxes, respectively.
This gives a good visual sense of how far you are.  For example:

- [x] Milestone one
- [ ] Milestone two
- [ ] Milestone three

Also, make sure to include some **optional** or **stretch** milestones that you can try for once
the base ones are completed.  This will help you quarantine cool ideas that may distract you from
the core requirements of the exercise.

# Recommended: Starter Code

For many of your past projects I've given you starter code.  This code implemented
helpful functions or contained the basics of the user interface.  You'll need starter
code eventually.  Consider making your starter code along with your milestones

While my O'Reilly videos should contain lots of good ideas for you, your starter code
should be **your own work**.  Do not copy and paste any code for this exercise.
