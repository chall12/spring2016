title: "Optional Extra Credit: Spring Break Hack"
---

This is your chance to shine!  I **highly recommend** doing a self guided project over the break to test out and reinforce your new skills.

Pick a substantive project and work on it in either Trinket or Cloud9 over spring break.  Submit it in a pull request with short reflection.  Your project should run error free and accomplish some functional or user-based milestones.

What are examples of hacks?

- A Turtle app much like the ones we've been making but exploring something new for you.  You can re-use can copy code with attribution.
- Sign up for Cloud 9 and follow a web-based tutorial on making a website.  NOTE: One trick with Cloud nine is that the host IP needs to be set to 0.0.0.0 (available on the command line as `$IP`) and the port needs to be 8080 (also available as `$PORT`)
- Make a data analysis trinket (or cloud 9 project)
- From Cloud 9, clone our class website with `git`, run it with `jekyll serve --watch --port $PORT --host $IP`, make a new post, set up `git`, make a new branch, commit, and push your commit.  Phew!  We'll do all of this at least once.

If you make a project via CLoud 9, make sure it's publicly visible (and up and running if it's a web app). Email me if you'd like to know whether a proposed hack would qualify and I can provide some limited email support over the break.
