title: Chapter 8 Lists Exercises

**Exercise 1:**

Write a function called `chop` that takes a list and modifies it, removing the first and last elements, and 
returns None.  **call** it several times to check your work.


**Exercise 2:** 

```python
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    # print 'Debug:', words
    if len(words) == 0 : continue
    if words[0] != 'From' : continue
    print(words[2])
```

Figure out which line of the above program is still not properly guarded. See if you can construct a text file 
which causes the program to fail and then modify the program so that the line is properly guarded and test it 
to make sure it handles your new text file.

**Exercise 3: **

Rewrite the guardian code in the above example without two if statements. Instead, use a compound logical expression using the and logical operator with a single if statement.
