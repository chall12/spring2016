**After your programs are done**, check other students' work and other resources online if you had questions.
Include a reflection about what you think you've learned and any concepts that are still fuzzy to you.
Did you encounter frustrating situations? Did you feel a lightbulb turn on?

Write a program that lets the user slam poetry.

Specifically, collect a series of text inputs by the user, until they type "done".

Use Python's Turtle to write these inputs on the screen, one under the other,
so that they're readable.
