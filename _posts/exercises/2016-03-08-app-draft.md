title: "Bring your app draft to class for an in-class clinic"
---

Bring your app draft to class for a peer clinic.  There's nothing to turn in so you can focus
on your app, but you should have made significant progress so that you can take advantage of the clinic.
We'll also have time to work on clinic feedback in class.

Almost to spring break!
