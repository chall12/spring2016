**Drawing App Idea:** Users can create their own ice-cream cone or bowl! 

- [ ] Milestone 1: User can click screen to draw ice cream cone or bowl.  (Two buttons to choose fromâ€”one for cone and one for bowl). 
- [ ] Milestone 2: User can change flavor (color) of ice cream.
- [ ] Milestone 3: User can add toppings by clicking on the screen (possible toppings include: chocolate chips, sprinkles, strawberries, cherry, nuts, chocolate/caramel/strawberry syrup, pretzels, peanut butter cups, brownie bits).  
- [ ] Milestone 4: Create menu option where users can click the screen for that topping and then click anywhere else on the screen to draw that topping there.  
- [ ] Milestone 5: User can clear screen and start over.
