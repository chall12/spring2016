**Drawing App Idea:** Users can create their own ice-cream cone or bowl!  

- [ ] Milestone 1: User can click screen to draw ice cream cone or bowl. (Two buttons to choose from, one for cone, one for bowl) 
- [ ] Milestone 2: User can change flavor (color) of ice cream.
- [ ] Milestone 3: User can add toppings by clicking on the screen (possible toppings: chocolate chips, sprinkles, strawberries, cherry, caramel, nuts, brownie bits, pretzels)
- [ ] Milestone 4: Create menu option where users can click the screen for that topping and then click anywhere else on the screen to draw that topping. 
- [ ] Milestone 5: User can clear screen and start over.
