**Reflection:**

While working on these exercises I found I was able to create these programs without a major struggle.  If I ran into a problem I was able to work out of it, however, while working on exercise four I started getting confused on how indices worked in python.  I thought the first index from the left started with 0 and then went up to however many characters the string has, but when I tried to do this in exercise 4 I didn’t get the results I was expecting.  

In exercise 4, I had the string ‘banana’ stored in the variable fruit.  I first tried print fruit.count('a', 0, 5), expecting to get 3 as a result, but this was not the case.  Instead my output was 2 for this command.  I then tried print fruit.count('a', 1,6).  This resulted in an output of 3 (what I was initially expecting and the correct answer for the number of “a’s” in ‘banana’).  So, my question here is, are indices started from 1 in Python?  (Or does it just work that way for the count method in Python?)
