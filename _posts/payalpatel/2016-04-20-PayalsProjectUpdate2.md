**Reflection:**

I worked on creating more options for my program in the last couple of days.  I did not make as much progress as I had hoped to (or as much as last time).  I think I overestimated how much work I would be able to get done in such a short time frame.  I was able to get my program running on Cloud 9 which has made working on my program a lot easier.  By the next class I hope to have completed all of my options and to have created one (or mulitple) visual data printouts.  I also plan to deal with different user errors/inputs when using the program.  I originally left "comment code" has a milestone under the "to be scheduled" section; however, I have decided to move that to the section with the milestones I plan to work on next.  I decided to do this because I have realized that commenting code is more of an ongoing process--it is easier to comment as you go rather than at the end.

**Old Plan:**

Milestones I will work on next:

- [x] create more options for program (since the next class is two days from this one, this will be the primary milestone I work on, the other ones mentioned below will be my focus over the weekend 

- [ ] visual data text printouts 


To be scheduled Milestones:

- [ ] deal with user error --using try/except, or if/elif? 

- [ ] help text --accessible throughout program 

- [ ] comment code 

- [ ] runs without errors 

- [x] format results from each option  --well, halfway (I did this for a couple of options, haven't finished for all.) 


Stretch Milestones:

- [ ] create at least one visual data text printout that is a vertical histogram 

- [x] use Cloud9

- [ ] compare data from two different csv files at the same time
