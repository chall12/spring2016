Reflection: 

Through this pair programming assignment we were able to work together to get the programs completed.  If one of us got stuck on something the other one was able to help which allowed for us to complete the program more quickly rather than working separately.  This pair programming experience was also helpful in that it allowed us to discuss this new topic which helped us become more familiar with some of the different concepts related to Regex exercises.
