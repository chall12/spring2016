**Logical Turtle Exercise:**
Create a turtle program that uses variables, conditionals, operators, and user input.

**Reflection:**
I think the most frustrating part of this exercise was trying to figure out how to incorporate variables, conditionals, operators, and user input into one turtle program.  Coming up with a creative way to incorporate these was more of a challenge for me rather than the actual implementation of these concepts. While working on this exercise I noticed that it is very easy to forget simple details (no matter how well you know the concept).  For example, in my program I included a "goto"--when trying to use "goto" in my program I couldn't get it to work the way I wanted to at first, but I soon realized that was because I added an equal sign next to it (something not required with the "goto" command).  I think I may have done this, because in commands before that one I was assignning values to different variables (in which I needed to use equal signs) so I must have subconsciously added it to the "goto" command without realizing it at the moment.  This experience showed me that it is important to review your code for little errors that you may not have expected.
