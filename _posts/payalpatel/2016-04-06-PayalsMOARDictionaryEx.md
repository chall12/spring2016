**Reflection:**

These exercises were challenging, but I think that I was able to work through them.  I frequently used print statements as a debugging technique in these exercises.  I think these exercises were helpful because there was repetition of some things between exercises.  This repetition allowed me to practice and gain familiarity with this material.  When working on exercises 2-5, I noticed that I couldnâ€™t run the trinket and have all of my exercises work at the same time.  At first I thought there was an error within my code, but when I opened a new trinket (or commented out the rest of the trinkets) and ran each exercise separately, the code executed without any errors.
