**Reflection:**

Below I have listed my milestones from the last class and below that I have my revised milestones.  I completed several of my milestones, including some I did not anticpate on completing until later on.  Some of the milestones I had listed under the "to be scheduled" section were actually some of the ones I started on or finished first.  To me this reflects my programming style--I have goals in mind, but I don't always complete them in the order I originally intend to.  I work on goals as I get ideas and inspiration for them.

While working on some of the different options for my program, I realized that I should format the data in a more visual appearing way for options that won't use a visual data printout.  This is something I will make sure to include in my program and I have listed it as a new milestone to make sure I don't forget. 

My plan is to focus on creating more options and to start woring on creating at least one visual data text printout in the next few days.  I have included realistic goals as well as some stretch goals that I would like to attempt once I have most of the requirements and major components of my program completed.   


**Milestones from last class:**


For Next Tues: 

- [x] determine what fields to include in data file 

- [x] create multiple data files using mockaroo â€“data files will be membership information for an organization

- [x] upload data files as csv files into python3 trinket 

- [x] determine how many options I will have (and what each option will do) --goal is to have at least 2 created by Tues. 

- [x] create function that counts number of people who work at each company (one option)

- [x] create & use a dictionary (use a dictionary to go through file and count how many people work for each company) 

- [x] include definite for loop (one place could be when creating a dictionary that counts number of people that work for each company)

- [x] create functions that count number of people in each state, gender, etc. (another option idea) 


To be Scheduled: 

- [ ] help text --accessible throughout program 

- [x] way to exit the program 

- [x] create an iterative interface

- [x] text based interface 

- [ ] use functions mentioned previously to create a visual data text printout (horizontal histogram)

- [ ] allow users to determine what information they will look at in the visual data text printout (state, company, etc.) 

- [ ] comment code 

- [ ] runs without errors 



**Milestones I will work on next:**

- [ ] create more options for program (since the next class is two days from this one, this will be the primary milestone I work on, the other ones mentioned below will be my focus over the weekend 

- [ ] visual data text printouts 


**To be scheduled Milestones:**

- [ ] deal with user error --using try/except, or if/elif? 

- [ ] help text --accessible throughout program 

- [ ] comment code 

- [ ] runs without errors 

- [ ] format results from each option  


**Stretch Milestone:**

- [ ] create at least one visual data text printout that is a vertical histogram 

- [ ] use Cloud9

- [ ] compare data from two different csv files at the same time
