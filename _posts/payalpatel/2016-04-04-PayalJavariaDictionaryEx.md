**Reflection:**

We both found this assignment challenging.  We initially worked on the assignment separately after class.  We made some progress through this way, however, when we met up we were able to accomplish much more.  We were able to discuss ideas and take turns pair programming.  It was more helpful to meet up after we read the chapter.  This allowed us to gain some perspective and knowledge of dictionaries.  To complete the exercises for this assignment we had to research a lot of information and topics related to dictionaries.  Most of the stuff we looked at was general, however, this site (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17732332/consolidating-two-dictionaries-with-the-same-keys-and-different-values) contains code that helped us create our dictionary of dictionaries.  Overall, our understanding of dictionaries has increased, but there are still some areas we arenâ€™t entirely comfortable.
