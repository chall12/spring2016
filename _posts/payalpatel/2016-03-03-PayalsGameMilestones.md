title: "Payal's Game Milestones"

At first I was thinking the purpose of my game would be for the user trying to find a hidden object, but now I’m think I’m going to have it where the user tries to collect as many objects as possible on the screen (this information will be displayed through the use of a counter).  Right now I’m deciding between these two ideas.  If I have time, I would like to figure out a way to switch between two different users (and use two different counters to determine how many objects they have collected).  

**Milestones:**

- [ ] user can use up/down/leftright arrows to move on the screen   
- [ ] create menu bar at the top 
- [ ] create key buttons for menu bar
- [ ] user can use up/down/left/right arrows to move on the screen
- [ ] create menu bar at the top 
- [ ] create buttons where user can click screen to change background/location 
- [ ] import images for button backgrounds?
- [ ] have hidden object at random location 
- [ ] OR have multiple objects the user has to collect 
- [ ] display show/display user's position in the corner (OR counter for # of objects collected) 
- [ ] use colors to indicated user's distance from object
- [ ] create two turtles to find hidden object (OR collect objects on the screen) if time/possible 


These milestones are subject to change. :)
