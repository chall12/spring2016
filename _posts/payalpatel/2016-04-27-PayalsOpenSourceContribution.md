title: "Payal's Open Source Contribution"
---
For my open-source contribution I originally was going to try the sahara eden project or openhatch.org; however, looking at these sites extensively I wasn’t able to find something that I felt I could contribute to.  After spending a long time searching these two sites I decided to conduct a google search.  Through this search I found Mozilla Firefox’s open-source website, www.whatcanidoformozilla.org.  This website was very user-friendly, especially for newcomers to open-source.  I completed two Web QA tasks for Mozilla.  The first was the Firefox Accounts/Sync Setup and the second was the Graphics Sanity Test.  These tasks were fairly simple and straightforward which I appreciated as a beginner to QA in open-source projects.  In the future I would definitely consider working on an open-source project; however, I would try to find something more challenging and I would like to find something involving more coding rather than user testing (even though user testing is very important!).  The following websites are the links to the tasks I completed: https://oneanddone.mozilla.org/tasks/3/ and https://oneanddone.mozilla.org/tasks/143/.  In order to complete any task you have to register for an account.  Once you complete a task your username will appear on that task’s page as one of the users who completed the task.
