**Reflection:**
I think the most challenging part of creating this program was making sure the text didn't overlap.  To do this I made tina move forward 20 in every loop after print the user's input.  I also turned tina in the direction I wanted her facing (the direction that would point down towards the text) outside of the loop.  By doing this I was able to make it so tina would print on a new line for each user input.  I thought about (and tried) using the newline character “\n”, but when I used it I didn’t get the output I had intended.  Thus, resulting in my decision to use tina.right and tina.forward (in the loop) to create a new line after each input.
