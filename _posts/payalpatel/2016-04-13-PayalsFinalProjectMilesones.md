For my final project I am going to do the data analysis project.  The data I am going to use will be generated using Mockaroo.  I have decided to use randomly generated data because I want to use data that reflects member information for an organization.  Organizations such as TriPython, GirlDevelopIt, Entrepreneur’s Organization, etc.  I decided I wanted to create a program that reads/analyzes membership information for organizations like these while I was collecting membership information for an organization I am currently in.  It got me to thinking how it would be interesting to analyze this information and compare it year after year to see how it changes (to see the male to female ratio, the different majors of each student, etc.)  This led to my decision to create sample data using Mockaroo to create data files that reflect membership information for organizations/groups that people participate in outside of their daily work.  Mockaroo has several pre-defined items to pick from such as First Name, Last Name, and SSN.  Mockaroo also has a custom list feature which allows you to enter your own sample data for the randomly generated data file.  In my data files I plan to include personal information of each member including first name, last name, ssn, race, street address, state, company, job title, salary, and more.  Right now I’m thinking about creating data files for one imaginary organization/group for different years.  I am also considering making data files for different organizations/groups that are similar to one another.  

**Milestones:**


For Next Tues: 

- [ ] determine what fields to include in data file 

- [ ] create multiple data files using mockaroo –data files will be membership information for an organization

- [ ] upload data files as csv files into python3 trinket 

- [ ] determine how many options I will have (and what each option will do) --goal is to have at least 2 created by Tues. 

- [ ] create function that counts number of people who work at each company (one option)

- [ ] create & use a dictionary (use a dictionary to go through file and count how many people work for each company) 

- [ ] include definite for loop (one place could be when creating a dictionary that counts number of people that work for each company)

- [ ] create functions that count number of people in each state, gender, etc. (another option idea) 


To be Scheduled: 

- [ ] help text --accessible throughout program 

- [ ] way to exit the program 

- [ ] create an iterative interface

- [ ] text based interface 

- [ ] use functions mentioned previously to create a visual data text printout (horizontal historgram)

- [ ] allow users to determine what information they will look at in the visual data text printout (state, company, etc.) 

- [ ] comment code 

- [ ] runs without errors
