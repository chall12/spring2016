**Reflection:**

I first started this assignment by diving right in, but I quickly realized that probably wasn’t the best approach.  Once I figured that out I decided to read through the requirements for our turtle treasure hunt.  From there I was able to put together a general idea of the commands I would need to use.  I realized that along with the while loop I would need to use the try/except and if/elif/else commands to get the turtle treasure hunt to work the way I wanted it to.  I had some difficulty including all of these into the while loop (the main problem was getting everything to line up in their correct/respective boxes so the code could be executed).  

Originally I was going to have user feedback printed on the main screen (written by Tina), however, after testing out the turtle treasure hunt I realized that after multiple tries the screen became cluttered with words.  As a result, I decided to only have Tina write on the main screen when the treasure was found.  To make sure the user would still receive feedback I would have a message print in the bottom of the screen so the user could know how close they were with messages such a “You’re getting warmer!” and “You’re freezing!”.  I also made it so Tina would change into one of five colors (red, orange, yellow, light blue, and dark blue) depending on her location to the treasure.
