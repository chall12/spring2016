**Reflection:**

Overall, I understand the general concepts of lists.  When working through these exercises I struggled with determining which line wasn’t properly guarded in exercise 2.  I understood what the code was created to do and I was able to take that code and revise it in exercise 3, but I don’t think I have a solid understanding of how to use guardian code.
