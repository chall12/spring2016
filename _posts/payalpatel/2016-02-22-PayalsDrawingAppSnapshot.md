My drawing app will allow users to create their own ice-cream cone.  So far I have worked on creating the layout of my app and the framework of the functions needed in the drawing app.  For example, I have created functions that create cherries, chocolate chips, and sprinkles (the toppings for the ice-cream cone) that can be added by the user.  Currently, I am having difficulty with trying to figure out how to have the user click on the button for the topping and then click elsewhere on the screen to have that topping drawn there.  I've experimented with the onclick function with little success, however, I will continue brainstorming ideas on how to make this possible.
