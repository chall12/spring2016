**Reflection:**

At first I thought both of these exercises were difficult.  I was having trouble starting, so in order to deal with this I split up the problems into divisible and more manageable tasks.  I then arranged them in an order that I thought made logical sense (in terms of completing each of these smaller subtasks).  For me this helped a lotâ€”I was able to focus on smaller tasks and then piece them together once I had finished the components.  

In the Chapter 5 reading, counting/summing/maximum/minimum loops were created using for loops.  I thought about using this, however, it seemed simpler to use the while loop and try/except.  To determine the maximum and minimums, I created an empty list which would then store numbers entered in by the user.  After that I calculated the maximum and minimum of this list and stored them into maximum and minimum variables, respectively.  

Overall, I found this exercise challenged me to think of how I could solve these problems.  These exercises helped me further understand the coding process and different approaches one can take when writing a program.
