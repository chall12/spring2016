For my second meetup I was planning on going to a people programming event in Durham along with a couple of my classmates.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to attend the people programming event because of some difficulties.  (None of us have a car and when we tried to Uber we couldn't get it to work in time for us to get there.)  Anyway, once we realized that we had already missed the start time for the event we started talking about the difficulties we were facing in order to get off campus as undergraduate students.  Ga Kay, Javaria, and I decided to try and have a similar "people programming" event of our own on Franklin Street.  We realized the purpose of the event was for people to meetup and discuss projects they were working on. So, we ended up going to Sweet Frog along with a couple of our friends to work on our programs, discuss our programs with one another, and enjoy some frozen yogurt at the same time. :)  It was nice talking to others about projects/classwork they were working on.  We also talked about different classes we had taken related to programming.  Overall, I think our informal meetup was a great way to meet other UNC students--specifically those who program.
