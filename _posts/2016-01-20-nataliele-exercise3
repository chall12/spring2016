Exercise 1: Rewrite your pay computation to give the employee 1.5 times the hourly rate for hours worked above 40 hours.

Exercise 2: Rewrite your pay program using try and except so that your program handles non-numeric input gracefully by printing a message and exiting the program.
I rewrote the program so that it'll print an error but will let user enter numbers again.

Exercise 3: Write a program to prompt for a score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the score is out of range, print an error message. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table:

Score   Grade
>= 0.9     A
>= 0.8     B
>= 0.7     C
>= 0.6     D
< 0.6    F
