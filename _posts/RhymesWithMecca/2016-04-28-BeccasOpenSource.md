title: "Becca's Open Source Contribution"
---

I stumbled upon the site for my open source contribution on Facebook, shortly after HB2 was passed.  It's a site called [Refuge Restrooms](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/) that provides a list of restrooms that are single occupancy or gender neutral.  One can search by their location and find all of the restrooms that fit the qualifications near their location.  The website lists ways to contribute to the cause on the website: adding listings, editing listingss, contributing code via GitHub, and donating money.  

I originally thought this assignment was to contribute in a coding sense, i.e. via GitHub, so I started shying away from this open source website after I clicked through the documentation and it wasn't very intelligible to this GitHub novice.  I then realized that we didn't necessarily need to submit in a coding sense.  Since Target has recently stated that they [support transgender rights](https://corporate.target.com/article/2016/04/target-stands-inclusivity), I added the six Target locations with safe restrooms that are closest to Chapel Hill to their database.  I included location name, address, city, state, and country.  Since I don't have a car and getting to any of the Targets would be difficult, I kept the default options for wheelchair accessibility (not accessible) and unisex standing (gendered single stall or safe place, rather than gender neutral).  Hopefully someone will see them and add notes (the restroom is in the back of the store) for completion's sake.  Here are my links:

1. [Target Durham SE](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/restrooms/21691)
2. [Durham Super Target](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/restrooms/21692)
3. [Cary West Target](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/restrooms/21693)
4. [Apex Super Target](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/restrooms/21694)
5. [Morrisville Target](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/restrooms/21695)
6. [Raleigh NW Target](http://www.refugerestrooms.org/restrooms/21696)

Once finals are over, I plan to go around Chapel Hill editing the listings for the restrooms on campus and on Franklin St.
