This took me less time than I thought it would.  I hope that's not a bad thing because it's not very creative, but I do think I've covered all my bases and I'm getting faster at both coding and troubleshooting.

Issues I Ran Into:
-I forgot to use two == for "if int(bard) == 5:" at first.  A look back at the chapter helped.
-I was wondering if it's possible to put strings in conditionals.  The only examples in the readings (I think) deal with numbers.  In other words, could I have done "Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet?'" as my conditional?
-I originally asked the user to answer "What is 2 to the 10th power?" in the math class section, but then realized we needed operators, so I changed it.
