---

**Here are my milestones:**

**Required**
 - [ ] interface is entirely graphical
 - [ ] game uses key events (tentatively to play the trivia game for numerical questions)
 - [ ] game uses click events (tentatively to play the trivia game for non-numerical questions [moving to certain spots on the screen to guess answers - spots drawn by extensions of Python's turtle class])
 - [ ] game has a reason to play (tentatively winning Harry Potter trivia/achieving eternal glory)
 - [ ] game displays win screen
 - [ ] game keeps track of state
 - [ ] game displays information that updates
 
**Stretch**
 - [ ] game uses key events to change turtle/player (I'm not sure if this is possible)
 - [ ] game has point accumulation
 
I want the game to be trivia.  I'm working on figuring out how to let the user win even if they get everything wrong.
