**Here is my Trinket:**

**For Tuesday - cDNA Capabilities**  

- [x] transcribe sequence into mRNA
- [x] make translate output pretty
- [x] count the number of each amino acid
- [x] print the length of the sequence
- [x] print the reverse complement
- [x] print the complementary DNA strand

**Reflection:**

I accomplished all of my goals!  I spent a fair amount of time, over two days and three separate periods of time, working on the program.  I edited the code I wrote for last Thursday (make translate output pretty) and wrote new code (other five milestones).  My plan from the beginning was to write all of the functional code and then make it pretty by adding functions and user input.  My group agreed with this plan when I ran it by them.  My program thus currently prints all of the capabilities when the user presses run.  Making it look pretty will happen this weekend or early next week, depending on how things go.

The one thing I'm having trouble with (style points rather than actual points, I think) is to let the program print the DNA/RNA/protein sequences without my having to specify the length in a bunch of if loops.  I'd like to write one for or while loop to do this.  I tried it with both a for and a while loop and neither worked.  I **think** this is possible, but I can't figure out how.  That might be a goal for the weekend when I have more time, though.  I will ask my group if they have any ideas.

For Thursday, I'd like to do the gDNA capabilities, since the code will be very similar to what I have for cDNA and there isn't much time between Tuesday and Thursday. 

**For Thursday - gDNA Capabilities**

 - [ ] print percent AT/GC content
 - [ ] print the length of the sequence
 - [ ] print the reverse complement
 - [ ] print the complementary DNA strand
