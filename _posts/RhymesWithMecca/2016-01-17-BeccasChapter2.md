The one thing I can't figure out is how to print a string and the variable you've save on the same line.  So in the first program, 
Hello and the person's name print on different lines.  It also took me a bit of time to realize that I needed to use int(hours)
instead of just hours after declaring it an integer.  This was just a problem of me not reading the chapter carefully enough...
