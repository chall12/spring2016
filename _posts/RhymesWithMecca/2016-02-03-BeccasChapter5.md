Here is Exercise 1:

Exercise 1 Thoughts:
This one took me a while.  First I had to figure out the proper order of the ifs, try/except, and while loop.  I needed to put the if and break statement before turning the input into a float.  I screwed up my indentation in the try conditional.  At one point, it took inputs but always printed the error message in the except loop.

Then I got stuck and went to sleep.  The next day, I tried it again with functions, but it was printing something like <function sum> and I couldn't figure out why.  The weird input messages were still occurring.  I attempted to use global x for the first time, but no dice.

I then looked ahead on the schedule and saw that Chapter 8 is about lists.  This looked promising.  Midway through the chapter, I saw a part about remaking the original summing program and thought that might be useful.  I used that to help me write my program.

The one thing I am still confused about is why you need to make a new name for the input for the user.  I called it x and then had to give it a new name (value).  When I didn't do this, I had the error messages.  I don't remember doing this in the past.

Exercise 2 Thoughts:
I could not come up with a way to do this without lists.  So I used one, and based the rest of the code on Exercise 1.  This one took a lot less time.
