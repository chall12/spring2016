**Here is our reflection:**
Becca: I had trouble with this assignment.  I don't think we had enough information or enough time in class to sufficiently understand the material on dictionaries, even if we had read the chapter ahead of time.  My code is not very pretty and it took me many hours to write the code.  I hope we have time to go over it in class tomorrow or Thursday in a matter that will help me understand the material.
Yiyang: Becca and I went through the first four questions smoothly together during the class. We were a little stuck on the fifth question, the dictionary within dictionary question. I found the reading very helpful after class and was able to solve the issue. I think it just needs some time to get familiar with dictionary, especially when we are used to list. Once familiared, dictionary can be very handy since one can just use many "[]"'s to take the values out of layers of dictionary.
