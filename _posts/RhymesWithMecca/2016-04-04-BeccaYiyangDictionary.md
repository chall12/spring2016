**Here is our reflection:**
I had trouble with this assignment.  I don't think we had enough information or enough time in class to sufficiently understand the material on dictionaries, even if we had read the chapter ahead of time.  My code is not very pretty and it took me many hours to write the code.  I hope we have time to go over it in class tomorrow or Thursday in a matter that will help me understand the material.
