Exercise 6 Thoughts:
I modeled the whole thing on the a + b = 8 example in the text.  I kept forgetting to include colons after defining functions.  Since submitting this exercise for the first time, I have learned that you don't need to define integers before including them in formulas, as well as how to print strings and integers in the same line, so I used my newly-found knowledge here.
I learned that order matters in functions - thus (computepay(overhours,rate)) and x = computepay(overhours,rate) need to have the variable order consistent.  I was confused when the math didn't work for a bit.
Lastly, my time-and-a-half formula seems to work well.

Exercise 7 Thoughts:
I donâ€™t quite see the point of modeling this whole thing as a function - doesn't it do exactly the same thing as before?  I learned that you need to call the computegrade function only once, not for each possible grade.  In other words, it should be on the same indent as where you define it.
