**Here is my reflection:**

It took me a bit to figure out that printing the dumps is for giving you all of the possible information.  Everything below that is formatted nicely and are examples of what we can use.  Then I had trouble interpreting the formatting of the dumps.  I made my screen wider but that wasnâ€™t all that useful.  So then I put the dumps in Brackets (my text editor) so they would format nicely and I could see which curly brace and which bracket lined up with which other one by clicking on one.  This was very helpful.  

It was then just a matter of using the model formatted variables to figure out how to format the ones I wanted to use.  This was a lot of trial and error.  Then I added a try and except loop such that the program would exit if it encountered an index error.  Then I was done.
