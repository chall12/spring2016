Here is my clicky turtles program:

I had fun with this assignment.  I have decided to use Harry Potter as my theme for all turtle assignments from now on (since the logical turtles assignment was not very interesting without a theme or flowers growing).

I figured out how to use strings as conditionals!  I think we were looking at someone's program as a class wherein this was a thing.  This skill made this program possible.

What I really wanted to be able to do, but I don't think is possible, is for me to click in one spot and Moony draws the wand.  Then the hat goes in a second clicked spot, and the Snitch goes in a third.  As it is, I had one clicky function for all three objects and I had to tell the user to click on the left side of the screen for all three to show up (I specified the distance between the objects).  Is it possible to have "clicky1, clicky2" or something?

I gave myself a bit of a geometry lesson midway through.  I wanted the hat to be an isosceles triangle, but the proportions weren't working.  I went with equilateral at the end, which is easier mathematically but not as nice of an image.  Oh well.
