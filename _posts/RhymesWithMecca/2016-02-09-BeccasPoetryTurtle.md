Reflection:
This did not take me very long.  I hope I'm not missing something.  I made some minor punctuation errors (colons and indents), but my
lingering issue is the writing part.  I think this is the first time I've had a turtle write using user input, and I want the font to 
be larger than default.  I tried: "andrea.write(poem[x], None, "center", "12 pt bold")" which didn't change anything and (I hope) 
conforms to the correct format.  I also tried putting 'poem[x]' in quotation marks, which just printed poem[x] a million times.  
How do you format user input?
