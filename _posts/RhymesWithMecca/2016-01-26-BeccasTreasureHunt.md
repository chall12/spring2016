I somehow managed to embed the link to the first assignment here by accident, so my analysis here is not going to be very complete.  It was a lot better in the first go-round (the one where I accidentally committed directly to gh-pages).  I apologize.

It took me a little while to realize that I needed to start with winning in my if loops and then go broader (very close, close, not close).  

I also did some troubleshooting with user input - how to ensure that I was getting a number inputted and what to do with bad input.

It took me until the testing stage to realize that I had to embed the code for Tina moving in the user input code - only if the coordinates are satisfactory can Tina start moving.
