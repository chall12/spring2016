There were two hard parts for me: getting the variables to work (int vs. string vs. float) and getting the animation to work. 

I solved the variables problems by trial and error (mostly error)

I ended up cutting-and-pasting the module from the assignments tab that Elliot wrote. I wrote my own at first but it didn't look as good as the pre-fabbed one.
